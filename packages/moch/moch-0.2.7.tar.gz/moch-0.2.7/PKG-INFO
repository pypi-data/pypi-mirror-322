## Moch - Python Regex CLI Tool!

Moch provides a terminal UI to test and develop regexes.

The aim of this project is to make it easier to test and develop regexes without having to leave the terminal or browse the web.

---

## Note...

Moch is an idea of a frustrated developer who got the task of developing regexes and not by a big corporation with deep pockets.

It is a project that is being developed by a single person in their free time.

If you feel Moch makes your regex journey a bit easier, saves you time and makes you more productive, please consider [sponsoring!](https://github.com/sponsors/dor1202)
Your donations will go a long way in keeping the project alive and beers in my fridge! 🍺

**Thank you!**
