# Gen Studio
_Visualization tools for GenJAX._

Current version: `2025.01.005`

-----

`genstudio.plot` provides a composable way to create interactive plots using [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/).

Key features:

- Functional, composable plot creation built on Observable Plot (with near 1:1 API correspondence between Python and JavaScript)
- Support for sliders & animations
- Works in Jupyter / Google Colab
- HTML mode which persists plots across kernel restart/shutdown, and a Widget mode which supports Python<>JavaScript interactivity
- Terse layout syntax for organizing plots into rows and columns
- Hiccup implementation for interspersing arbitrary HTML

For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the [Gen Studio User Guide](https://studio.gen.dev).
