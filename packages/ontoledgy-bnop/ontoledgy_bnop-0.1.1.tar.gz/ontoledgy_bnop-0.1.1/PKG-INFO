## Documentation

#### Background

The Agile Manifesto prefers “working software over comprehensive documentation”. Robert C. Martin, one of the original authors of the Agile Manifesto, is also the author of the book Clean Code.

In this book, he makes a strong case for code being self-documenting: saying things such as "always try to explain yourself in code."

He suggests that the goal of every programmer should be to write code so clean and expressive that code comments are unnecessary.

When a programmer writes a comment, it will usually mean that they have failed to write code that was expressive enough. At the extreme, he suggests, maybe a little rhetorically, that "comments are always failures".

#### The OntoLedgy documentation policy

To aim to write code so clean and expressive that code comments are unnecessary.
