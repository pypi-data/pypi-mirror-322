              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# snowpark-checkpoints-collectors

---
**NOTE**

This package is on Private Preview.

---

**snowpark-checkpoints-collector** package offers a function for extracting information from PySpark dataframes. We can then use that data to validate against the converted Snowpark dataframes to ensure that behavioral equivalence has been achieved.
## Features

- Schema inference collected data mode (Schema): This is the default mode, which leverages Pandera schema inference to obtain the metadata and checks that will be evaluated for the specified dataframe. This mode also collects custom data from columns of the DataFrame based on the PySpark type.
- DataFrame collected data mode (DataFrame): This mode collects the data of the PySpark dataframe. In this case, the mechanism saves all data of the given dataframe in parquet format. Using the default user Snowflake connection, it tries to upload the parquet files into the Snowflake temporal stage and create a table based on the information in the stage. The name of the file and the table is the same as the checkpoint.



## Functionalities

### Collect DataFrame Checkpoint



```python
from pyspark.sql import DataFrame as SparkDataFrame
from snowflake.snowpark_checkpoints_collector.collection_common import CheckpointMode
from typing import Optional

# Signature of the function
def collect_dataframe_checkpoint(
    df: SparkDataFrame,
    checkpoint_name: str,
    sample: Optional[float] = None,
    mode: Optional[CheckpointMode] = None,
    output_path: Optional[str] = None,
) -> None:
    ...
```

- `df`: The input Spark dataframe to collect.
- `checkpoint_name`: Name of the checkpoint schema file or dataframe.
- `sample`: Fraction of DataFrame to sample for schema inference, defaults to 1.0.
- `mode`: The mode to execution the collection (Schema or Dataframe), defaults to CheckpointMode.Schema.
- `output_path`: The output path to save the checkpoint, defaults to current working directory.


## Usage Example

### Schema mode

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from snowflake.snowpark_checkpoints_collector import collect_dataframe_checkpoint
from snowflake.snowpark_checkpoints_collector.collection_common import CheckpointMode

spark_session = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
sample_size = 1.0

pyspark_df = spark_session.createDataFrame(
    [("apple", 21), ("lemon", 34), ("banana", 50)], schema="fruit string, age integer"
)

collect_dataframe_checkpoint(
    pyspark_df,
    checkpoint_name="collect_checkpoint_mode_1",
    sample=sample_size,
    mode=CheckpointMode.SCHEMA,
)
```


### Dataframe mode

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from snowflake.snowpark_checkpoints_collector import collect_dataframe_checkpoint
from snowflake.snowpark_checkpoints_collector.collection_common import CheckpointMode
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, ByteType, StringType, IntegerType 

spark_schema = StructType(
    [
        StructField("BYTE", ByteType(), True),
        StructField("STRING", StringType(), True),
        StructField("INTEGER", IntegerType(), True)
    ]
)

data = [(1, "apple", 21), (2, "lemon", 34), (3, "banana", 50)]

spark_session = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
pyspark_df = spark_session.createDataFrame(data, schema=spark_schema).orderBy(
    "INTEGER"
)

collect_dataframe_checkpoint(
    pyspark_df,
    checkpoint_name="collect_checkpoint_mode_2",
    mode=CheckpointMode.DATAFRAME,
)
```
