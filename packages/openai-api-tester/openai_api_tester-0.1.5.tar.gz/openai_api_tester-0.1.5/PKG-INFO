# OpenAI API Tester

OpenAI API Tester is a tool designed to interact with APIs compatible with OpenAI's format. It uses the [FastAPI framework](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org) to provide a seamless interface for quickly testing various APIs. Form inputs are stored in the browser's local storage, so you can pick up where you left off.
