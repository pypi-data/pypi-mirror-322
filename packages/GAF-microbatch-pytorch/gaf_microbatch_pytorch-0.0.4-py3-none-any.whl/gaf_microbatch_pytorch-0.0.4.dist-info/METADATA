## Gradient Agreement Filtering - Pytorch

Implementation of [Gradient Agreement Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18052), from Chaubard et al. of Stanford, but done for single machine microbatches, in Pytorch.

The official repository that does filtering for macrobatches across machines is [here](https://github.com/Fchaubard/gradient_agreement_filtering)

## Install

```bash
$ pip install GAF-microbatch-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch

# mock network

from torch import nn

net = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(512, 256),
    nn.SiLU(),
    nn.Linear(256, 128)
)

# import the gradient agreement filtering (GAF) wrapper

from GAF_microbatch_pytorch import GAFWrapper

# just wrap your neural net

gaf_net = GAFWrapper(
    net,
    filter_distance_thres = 0.97
)

# your batch of data

x = torch.randn(16, 1024, 512)

# forward and backwards as usual

out = gaf_net(x)

out.sum().backward()

# gradients should be filtered by set threshold comparing per sample gradients within batch, as in paper

```

You can supply your own gradient filtering method as a `Callable[[Tensor], Tensor]` with the `filter_gradients_fn` kwarg as so

```python

def filtering_fn(grads):
    # make your big discovery here
    return grads
 
gaf_net = GAFWrapper(
    net = net,
    filter_gradients_fn = filtering_fn
)

```

## Todo

- [ ] replicate cifar results on single machine
- [x] allow for excluding certain parameters from being filtered
