# Evil's Mutual Linear Probability Detection
## Regular Gameplay
### Run
Python 3.6 or above is required.  
Type `python -m emlpd lang=en_en` in the terminal.
### Game Rule Introduction
You need to follow the hints given to you in the game interface to defeat the
Evil. To defeat the Evil, you need to make the Evil's HP 0 or less and your HP
above 0.  
At the beginning of each round, the game will tell you the counts of true and
false bullets are in the main clip. Each turn, you can choose to shoot at
yourself or the opposite.   
If you shoot at yourself and all the bullets are false bullets and do not
explode, you will shoot again in the next turn, otherwise the opposite will
shoot.  
If 1 true bullet is shot, it causes 1 point of base damage (may be defended
against).  
Each shot has a chance of exploding (i.e., making the bullet act to the
opposite; can be changed with a tool), see _Tool 21: **Pò Qiāng**_.  
If a side has a hurting point of _n_(0≤_n_≤8,_n_∈**N**), then for each point of
true bullet damage to the opposite, there is a probability of _n_/8 that it
will result in an additional HP of damage, and a probability of 1−_n_/8 that it
will result in a hurting point plus 1. Hurting point is initially 0.  
If a side has _m_(0≤_m_≤32,_m_∈**N**) and a hurting point of
_n_(0≤_n_≤8,_n_∈**N**), and if _m_>0, then this side's stamina decrease by 1
for each shot. Each turn this side's stamina has a 1/(_n_+1) probability of
increasing by 1. When _m_<8, there is a probability of 1−_m_/8 of that this
side will get dazed for a turn.  
If a side have _n_(_n_∈**N₊**) dazing turns, then if it would have been this
side to shoot in the next turn, then the opposite still shoots in the next turn
and the number of this side's dazing turns becomes _n_−1.
#### Game Cycles
##### Turn
Shooting 1 time is called 1 turn.
##### Round
Giving 1 new clips is called 1 round.
##### Period
Changing 1 new Evil is called 1 period.
##### Game
Game running 1 time is called 1 game.
#### Tools' Descriptions
##### Tool 0: Liáng Qiāng(Yī)
Decrease your stacked badguns by 1 if **Pò Qiāng** is used by the opposite,
otherwise increase your stacked goodgun(foo) by 1.  
_See Tool 21: **Pò Qiāng**_
##### Tool 1: Liáng Qiāng(Èr)
Decrease your stacked badguns by 1 if **Pò Qiāng** is used by the opposite,
otherwise increase your stacked goodgun(bar) by 1.  
_See Tool 21: **Pò Qiāng**_
##### Tool 2: Xiǎo Dāo
If _n_(_n_∈**N**) **Xiǎo Dāo**s is used this turn, attach _n_ points of
additional damage for each true bullets shot this turn.
##### Tool 3: Kāi Guà(Yī)
Let the outermost bullet of the main clip quit(make it disappear), and tell you
whether the bullet was true or false.
##### Tool 4: Chāo Jí Xiǎo Mù Chuí
Let the number of the opposite's dazing turn increase by 1.
##### Tool 5: Dào Dé De Chóng Gāo Zàn Xǔ
Suppose your current HP is _m_(_m_∈**N₊**), hurting point is
_n_(0≤_n_≤8,_n_∈**N**), if _m_≤3+_n_/3, there is a probability of 100% that
your HP will increase by 1; if _m_>3+_n_/3, there is a probability of
pow(2,3+_n_/3−_m_) that your HP will increase by 1.
##### Tool 6: Tòu Shì Jìng
Tells you whether it is true or false of the outermost bullet of each clip (the
top message describes the main clip's).
##### Tool 7: Ná Lái Zhǔ Yì
If the opposite has _n_(_n_∈**N**) non-limited tools, there is a probability of
1/(_n_+1) of gaining a non-limited tool equally likely, and a probability of
1−1/(_n_+1) of fetching 1 non−limited tool from the opposite equally likely.  
The two are opposite events.
##### Tool 8: Nǐ De Jiù Shì Wǒ De
This is an OP tool.  
Share the opposite's tool warehouse with you, and you will not be able to use
the tools in your warehouse at that time. There is a 30% chance of sharing 1
round, a 50% chance of sharing 2 rounds, and a 20% chance of sharing 3 rounds.
All three are mutually exclusive.
##### Tool 9: Fáng Dàn Yī
Append a bulletproof wearing with a durability exponent of 3 to the outermost
layer. When you have at least 1 bulletproof wearing, when a bullet is shot at
you, suppose the extra damage value of the turn is _n_(_n_∈**N**), the
outermost bulletproof wearing will first reduce randint(1,⌈√(_n_+1)⌉) points of
durability exponent. Subsequently, suppose the durability exponent of the
outermost bulletproof wearing is _m_(_m_∈**Z**), if _m_<0, the bulletproof
wearing has a probability of 1−pow(2,_m_) of disappearing.  
If 1 bulletproof wearing disappears, your break care potential increases by 1;
if there is no bulletproof weareing after the bulletproof wearing disappears,
each point of your break care potential has a probability of 15% of turning
into a point of break care round, and a probability of 85% of nothing
happening. If the point of break care rounds is greater than 0, you will not be
able to use any tools in the following rounds, and you will randomly shoot at
either yourself or the opposite, and the point of break care rounds will
decrease by 1 for every 1 round that passes.
##### Tool 10: Fǎn Jiǎ
_Not Implemented Yet_
##### Tool 11: Tóu Zi
Let _m_=randint(1,6)+randint(1,6)+randint(1,6). If _m_=3, you will break care
for 2 rounds; if _m_=4, your HP will decrease by 2 and tell you so; if _m_=5,
the true-false state of the bullets in the main clip changes randomly from the
outside to the inside from the 3rd bullet; if _m_=6, your HP will decrease by 1
and tell you so; if _m_=7, one of your non-limited tools disappears; if _m_=9,
your stamina will increase by 1 until reaching the maximum; if _m_=10, your HP
will increase by 1 and tell you so; if _m_=11, your stamina will increase by 2
until reaching the maximum; if _m_=12, your additional damage for the current
turn will increase by 2, and there is a probability of 50% that you will be
told so; if _m_=13, the opposite's HP will decrease by 1 and tell you so; if
_m_=14, the opposite has a probability of 1/3 of being dazed for 1 more turn,
and a probability of 2/3 of being dazed for 2 more turns, which are opposite
events; if _m_=15, the opposite's HP will decrease by 2 and tell you so; if
_m_=18, the opposite's HP will become 1/8th of what it was originally
(floored), and tell you so.
##### Tool 12: Cáo Wèi Yán Qī
Suppose you currently have _n_(_n_∈**N**) temporary slots. If _n_=0, this tool
will not be used; if _n_>0, for each temporary slot, there is a 100%
probability of postponing 1 round.
##### Tool 13: Jìng Zi
This is an OP tool.  
For HP, hurting point, stamina, tool warehouse, stacked goodgun(foo), stacked
goodgun(bar), additional damage of current turn, bulletproof wearings, stacked
bullet catcher, stacked repeater, stacked combo shooter, stacked badgun,
stacked bandage, there is a probability of 50% that yours become the
opposite's, and tells “You've turned into the Evil”; there is a probability of
50% that the opposite's become yours, and tells “The Evil has turned into you”.
The two are opposite events.  
And your and the opposite's dazing turns will become 0.
##### Tool 14: Jiē Dàn Tào
Let your stacked bullet catcher increase by 1. Suppose you currently have
_n_(_n_∈**N₊**) stacked bullet catchers, the opposite's additional damage is
_m_(_m_∈**N**), if the opposite shoots 1 true bullet, there is a probability of
(1−0.8*ⁿ*)/(1+_m_) that you will catch it(avoids the damage from the bullet and
tells you “You caught a bullet”) and put it into the tail of the main clip, and
let your stacked bullet catcher be 0; if the opposite shoots 1 false bullet,
there is a probability of 0.8/(1+_m_) that you will catch it(tells you “You
caught a bullet”) and put it into the tail of the main clip, and let your
stacked bullet catcher decrease by 1.
##### Tool 15: Tián Shí
Suppose there are _n_(_n_∈**N₊**) bullets in the main clip now, then for
each false bullet in the main clip there is a probability of 1/_n_ that it will
become a true bullet. If at least one false bullet becomes a true bullet, the
message “The clip has changed” will be displayed.
##### Tool 16: Chóng Zhěng Dàn Yào
Temporarily take all bullets in the main clip out and put them back to the main
clip one by one. You can specify where to put each bullet, but whether it is a
true bullet or a false bullet that is put back in will only be shown when it is
put in. For example, in the following case: `0T1F2T3T4F5`, inputting `0` will
place one bullet in the outermost part of the main clip, inputting `5` will
place one bullet in the innermost part of the main clip, and inputting `3` will
place one bullet in the location of the two continuous true bullets in the
example. After all bullets have been put, the message “You've arranged the
bullets” will be displayed.
##### Tool 17: Shuāng Fā Shè Shǒu
Let your stacked repeater count increase by 1.  
_See Tool 18: **Lián Fā Shè Shǒu**_
##### Tool 18: Lián Fā Shè Shǒu
Let your stacked combo shooter count increase by 1.  
Suppose currently you have _m_(_m_∈**N**) stacked repeaters, _n_(_n_∈**N**)
stacked combo shooters, amount of the bullets in main clip is _r_(_r_∈**N₊**),
if you shoot at the opposite, then at least min(_r_,1+_m_) bullets will be
shot, and there will be a probability of 1−2⁻*ⁿ* shooting 1 more bullet(if there
exists a bullet in the clip). In other words, when _n_>0, there is a
probability of min(1,pow(1−2⁻*ⁿ*,_r_−1−_m_)) of clearing the clip. Suppose
_s_(_s_∈**N₊**) bullets are shot from the main clip, if _s_>_n_, then your
stacked combo shooter will become 0; if _s_≤_n_, then your stacked combo
shooter will decrease by _s_. For each additional shot bullet(by stacked
repeater), it makes stacked repeater count decrease by 1.
##### Tool 19: Yìng Bì
This is an OP tool.  
There is a probability of 50% that you will be given an OP tool that does not
exceed the sending limit (not counted in the total number of shots given out)
and a probabulity of 50% that your HP will be halved (floored after halving).
The two are opposite events.
##### Tool 20: Rán Shāo Dàn
_Not Implemented Yet_
##### Tool 21: Pò Qiāng
Increase the opposite's stacked badgun by 1.  
Suppose the current explosion exponent is _h_(_h_∈**N**), your stacked
goodgun(foo) count is _m_(_m_∈**N**), your stacked goodgun(bar) count is
_n_(_n_∈**N**), and your stacked badgun number is _r_(_r_∈**N**). If shooting
at oneself, when _r_>0, there is a 100% probability of exploding for each
bullet shot; when _r_=0 and _m_>0, there is a 0% probability of exploding for
each bullet shot; otherwise, there is a probability of
(1−pow(1023/1024,_h_+200))² of exploding for each bullet shot. If shooting at
the opposite, when _r_>0, there is a 100% probability of exploding for each
bullet shot; when _r_=0 and _n_>0, there is a 0% probability of exploding for
each bullet shot; otherwise, there is a probability of
(1−pow(1023/1024,_h_+200))² of exploding for each bullet shot. The explosion
exponent increases by 1 when each bullet shot (whether exploded or not).
##### Tool 22: Qǔ Chū Zǐ Dàn
Take 1 bullet from the location you specified out from the main clip and change
it to a tool **Shí Dàn** or **Kōng Dàn** and tell you so.
##### Tool 23: Kōng Dàn
Put 1 false bullet into a location specified by you in the main clip and tell
you so.
##### Tool 24: Shí Dàn
Put 1 true bullet into a location specified by you in the main clip and tell
you so.
##### Tool 25: Shén Mì Zǐ Dàn
Put 1 mysterious bullet into a location specified by you in the main clip and
tell you so.  
A “mysterious bullet” is a bullet whose true-false state is unknown and which
has a probability of 50% of affecting the true-false state of the bullet next
to the bullet put directioned inside (if exists).
##### Tool 26: Bēng Dài
Decrease your hurting point by 1 after 2 rounds. If the number of current
pending bandages is greater than or equal to your hurting point, this tool will
not be used.
##### Tool 27: Yī Liáo Bāo
If you have less than 2 HP, make you regain 5 HP; if you have less than 5 HP,
make you regain 4 HP; if you have less than 9 HP, make you regain 3 HP; if you
have less than 14 HP, make you regain 2 HP; if you have more than or equal to
14 HP, make you regain 1 HP. Additionally, if you have 0 hurting points, make
you get 2 HP back, and if you have less than 4 hurting points, make you get 1
HP back. HP regained based on HP are told to you, while HP regained based on
hurting points are not told to you.
##### Tool 28: Kāi Guà(Èr)
Instantly give a batch of new clips(current clips will not be retained).
##### Tool 29: Shuāng Qiāng Huì Gěi Chū Dá Àn
This is an OP tool.  
Add 1 xor 2 extra clips. Just added by copying existing clips to new extra
clips. It will not prompt.
##### Tool 30: Suǒ Yǒu Huò Yì Wú Suǒ Yǒu
This is an OP tool.  
There is a probability of 50% that both sides' tool warehouses and bulletproof
wearings will be cleared, and the additional damage will become zero.
##### Tool 31: Chāo Jí Dà Mù Chuí
This is an OP tool.  
Suppose currently the main clip contains _n_(_n_∈**N₊**) bullets, make the
opposite's dazing turns increase by _n_.
##### Tool 32: Bù Sǐ Bù Xiū
This is an OP tool.  
Initiate a stage battle, you and your opponent need to wager a certain amount
of HP(integer, min 1, max current HP), which your opponent cannot refuse.
During a stage battle, a batch of infinite bullet clips will be given out, and
your and your opponent's wager will be the initial HP for the stage battle. No
tools will be given out. When one side's HP reaches 0 or less, the other side
wins the stage battle and then receives the sum of their bets' HPs, and the
stage battle ends.
##### Tool 33: Qiāng Tǒng Wéi Xiū
Make the explosion exponent 2/3 of what it was(floored) and tell you
“You've mended the barrel”. If the explosion exponent is less than or equal to
0, this tool will not be used.
##### Tool 34: Kōng Shí Fēn Lí
For each clip, move all true bullets in it to the outermost place, all false
bullets in it to the innermost place and prompt “The clip has done 空实分离”.
##### Tool 35: Dàn Jiá Hé Bìng
Move the bullets in each extra clip (0→1→2 order) to the end of the main clip
in their original order, and prompt “You've merged the clips”. If there are no
extra clips or no bullets in all extra clips, this tool will not be used.

### Custom Game Mode
Predefined game modes are in [emlpd.gameinst](emlpd/gameinst.py), defined by
`GAMEMODE_SET`. This is the default setting of `GAMEMODE_SET`:

```python3
from typing import Dict, Iterable, Optional, Tuple, Union
from emlpd.gameapi import Game

class NormalGame(Game): ...

normal_mode: NormalGame = ...
infinite_mode: NormalGame = ...
xiaodao_party: NormalGame = ...
dice_kingdom: NormalGame = ...
class InfiniteMode2: ...
combo_party: NormalGame = ...
exploded_test: NormalGame = ...
onlybyhand: NormalGame = ...

GAMEMODE_SET: Dict[int, Union[
    Tuple[Iterable[Game], int, float],
    Tuple[Iterable[Game], int, float, str, Optional[str]]
]] = {
    1: ((normal_mode,), 2, 2.5, "普通模式", "新手入门首选"),
    2: ((infinite_mode,), 2, 2.5, "无限模式(一)", "陪你到天荒地老"),
    3: ((xiaodao_party,), 3, 3., "小刀狂欢", "哪发是实弹?"),
    4: ((dice_kingdom,), 4, 2.25, "骰子王国", "最考验运气的一集"),
    5: (InfiniteMode2(), 2, 2.5, "无限模式(二)",
        "霓为衣兮风为马,云之君兮纷纷而来下"),
    6: ((combo_party,), 3, 2.5, "连射派对", "火力全开"),
    7: ((exploded_test,), 2, 1.75, "炸膛测试", "枪在哪边好使?"),
    8: ((onlybyhand,), 1, 2.5, "赤手空“枪”", "没有道具了")
}
```
You need to create a Python script, create a `Game` object(which is defined in
[emlpd.gameapi](emlpd/gameapi.py)) in it, and add it into `GAMEMODE_SET`, for example:
```python3
from emlpd.gameapi import Game
from emlpd.gameinst import GAMEMODE_SET, gen_tools_from_generic_tools

my_gamemode: Game = Game( # For parameters' detail, see Game.__doc__
    2,
    10,
    8,
    0,
    10,
    100,
    90,
    gen_tools_from_generic_tools(
        (0, 1, 21) # Include predefined tools' IDs, can be empty; see
                   # emlpd.gameinst.GENERIC_TOOLS
    ),
    {
        0: 1,
        1: 1,
        21: 2
    },
    {
        0: 0,
        1: 0,
        21: 0
    },
    {
        0: 2,
        1: 2,
        21: 4
    },
    7,
    False
)

GAMEMODE_SET[
    9 # Game mode ID
] = (
    (my_gamemode,), # An iterable includes Game
    1, # Specify the maximal tools sent per round for both side
    2.75, # Specify the EXP multiplier
    "Game Mode Name",
    "Game Mode Description"
)

import emlpd.__main__ # type: ignore # import cannot be omitted!
```
And run the script above, you will see:
```text
Game Mode 9: Game Mode Name
Introduction: Game Mode Description
```
Input `9` for entering custom game mode.
## Classic Gameplay
### Run
Python 3.6 or above is required.  
Type `python -m emlpd.classic lang=en_en` in the terminal.
### Game Rule Introduction
You need to follow the hints given to you in the game interface to defeat the
Evil. To defeat the Evil, you need to make the Evil's HP 0 or less and your HP
above 0.  
At the beginning of each round, the game will tell you the counts of true and
false bullets are in the clip. Each turn, you can choose to shoot at yourself
or the opposite.  
If you shoot at yourself and the bullet is a false bullet, you will shoot again
in the next turn, otherwise the opposite will shoot.  
If 1 true bullet is shot, it causes 1 point of base damage.  
If a side have _n_(_n_∈**N₊**) dazing turns, then if it would have been this
side to shoot in the next turn, then the opposite still shoots in the next turn
and the number of this side's dazing turns becomes _n_−1.
