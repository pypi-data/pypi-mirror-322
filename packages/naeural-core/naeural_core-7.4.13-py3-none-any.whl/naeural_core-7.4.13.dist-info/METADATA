# Naeural Edge Protocol Core Modules

Welcome to the Naeural Edge Protocol Core Modules repository. These modules form the backbone of the Naeural Edge Protocol, enabling the creation of end-to-end AI pipelines for edge computing. This README provides an overview of the core functionality, components, and how to get started with the Naeural Edge Protocol.

## Overview

The Naeural Edge Protocol is designed to facilitate the rapid development and deployment of AI applications at the edge. These core modules are responsible for the following key functionalities:

- **Data Collection**: Acquire data via multiple methods, including:
  - Default plugins: MQTT, RTSP, CSV, ODBC
  - Custom-built plugins for sensors and other data sources

- **Data Processing**: Transform and process collected data to prepare it for trustless model training and inference.

- **Model Training and Inference**: Use plugins to train AI models and perform trustless inference tasks.

- **Post-Inference Business Logic**: Run business logic post-inference to derive actionable insights and decisions.

- **Pipeline Persistence**: Ensure the persistence of pipelines for reliability and reproducibility.

- **Communication**: Facilitate communication through MQ-based and API-based methods, including routing and load balancing via ngrok.

These modules can be used as the core for implementing edge nodes within the Naeural Edge Protocol or integrated into third-party Web2 implementations.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily extend functionality with custom plugins for data collection, processing, and more.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale from small edge devices to large-scale deployments.
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with a variety of data sources and communication protocols.
- **Ease of Use**: Provides low-code/no-code development capabilities for rapid pipeline creation.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. Please read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute to the project.

### Installation

To install the naeural_core package on systems without cuda capabilities, run

```bash
pip install naeural_core
```

To install the naeural_core package on systems with cuda capabilities, run

```bash
pip install naeural_core --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

You can change the cuda driver with the one you already have. (For cuda 11.7, use cu117)

If the installation fails, try to run it again with the flags `--upgrade` and `--force-reinstall`

```bash
pip install naeural_core --upgrade --force-reinstall --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```
