A Python package to expose LuxCoreRender Python API.

# LuxCoreRender
LuxCoreRender is a physically correct, unbiased rendering engine.
It is built on physically based equations that model the transportation of
light. This allows it to accurately capture a wide range of phenomena which
most other rendering programs are simply unable to reproduce.

# LuxCore Python API - pyluxcore
LuxCore is written in C++, but also provides Python bindings. This package is
just a thin wrapper around those bindings.

# Install

`pip install pyluxcore`
