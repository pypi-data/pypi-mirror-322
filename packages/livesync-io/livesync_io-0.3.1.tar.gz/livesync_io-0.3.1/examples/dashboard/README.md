## Simple Dashboard

This is a simple dashboard demo built with LiveSync and PyQt6 that shows how to create a real-time video processing workflow:

- The app creates a GUI window with video display and control settings (camera selection, resolution, FPS)
- The workflow consists of simple layers: WebcamInput → FpsControl → ResolutionControl → Display

To run the demo:

```bash
rye run run
```
