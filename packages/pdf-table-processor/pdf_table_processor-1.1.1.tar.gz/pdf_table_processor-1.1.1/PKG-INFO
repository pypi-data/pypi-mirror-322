PDF-to-CSV-JSON AI Web Application Effortlessly extract structured complex data tables from your PDF documents and convert it into clean, ready-to-use CSV or JSON files. Powered by cutting-edge AI and optimized for real-world use cases, this application simplifies data extraction like never before.

ðŸš€ Features AI-Driven Extraction: Intelligent algorithms ensure accurate data parsing from PDFs, even for complex layouts. User-Friendly Interface: Upload your PDF, specify the target pages, and receive a downloadable CSV-JSON in seconds. Advanced Error Handling: Ensures clean outputs with minimal data loss. Powerful Integrations: Built with support for Hugging Face models, Camelot library, and vector databases. ðŸ”§ Tech Stack Backend: Python (FastAPI), Hugging Face Transformers Frontend: React.js PDF Processing: gmft, PyPDF2 Database: PostgreSQL AI Features: Custom NER and summarization models

Use Cases This application is tailored to handle real-world scenarios where accurate and efficient PDF data extraction is critical. Here are some specific use cases:

Complex Table Extraction Extract intricate and multi-layered tables from PDFs with precision. Handle nested headers, merged cells, and irregular column structures seamlessly. Ideal for financial reports, research papers, and government data with complex tabular layouts.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration Transform extracted data into structured formats for use in AI workflows. Use the generated CSVs to power retrieval-based systems like chatbots, summarization tools, or decision-support applications. Streamline document-based knowledge retrieval pipelines.
Large-Scale Data Processing Process bulk PDF uploads for large-scale data extraction needs. Generate clean CSV outputs for integration into analytics platforms or machine learning pipelines.
Business Intelligence Enable data teams to quickly extract actionable insights from complex PDF reports. Use the structured CSV outputs for dashboards, reports, and predictive modeling.
Automation in Operations Automate repetitive data extraction tasks to save time and reduce manual errors. Useful for industries such as logistics (invoice processing), healthcare (patient reports), and legal (contract analysis).
Compliance and Audit Extract key financial or operational metrics for regulatory compliance and audits. Ensure data integrity by minimizing human intervention during the extraction process.
Document Summarization and Analysis Leverage the extracted data to build summaries or generate insights using advanced AI models. Suitable for simplifying decision-making processes in research or business contexts.
