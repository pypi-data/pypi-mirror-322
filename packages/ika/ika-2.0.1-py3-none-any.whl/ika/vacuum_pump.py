    Command syntax and format:
        - Transmission process: Asynchronous character transmission in start-stop operation.
        - Transmission type: Full duplex.
        - Character format: Character composition according to data format in DIN 66022 for start-stop operation. 1
            start bit, 7 character bits, 1 parity bit (even), 1 stop bit.
        - Transmission speed: 9600 Bits/s.
        - Data flow control: none
        - Access method: Data transmission from the device to the computer only occurs after a _request from the
          computer.
        - The device only responds to requests from the computer. Even error messages are not send spontaneously from
          the device to the computer (automation system).
        - The commands are transmitted in captial letters.
        - Commands and parameters, as well as consecutive parameters, must be separated by at least one
            space (code: hex 0x20).
        - Each individual command (including parameters and data) and all responses are completed with
            CRLF (code: hex 0x20 hex 0x0d hex 0x0A) and can have a maximum length of 50 characters.
        - The dot is used for decimal separators in a floating-point value
(code: hex 0x2E).
    About watchdog:
        watchdog functions monitors the serial data flow. if, once this function has been activated there is no
        retransmission of the command from the computer within the set time ("watchog time:), the Evacuation function
        is switched off in accordance with the set “watchdog” mode or is returned to previously set target values.
        The data transmission may be interrupted by, for example, a crash in the operating system, a power failure in
        the PC or an issue with the connection cable between the computer and the device.
        watchdog mode 1
            - If event WD1 should occur, the evacuation function is switched off and WD1 Watchdog Error is displayed.
              Set watchdog time to m (20 - 1,500) seconds, with watchdog time echo. This command launches the
              watchdog function
        watchdog mode 2
            - If there is an interruption in data communications (longer than the set watchdog time),
              the speed target value is changed to the set WD safety speed limit. The warning PC 2 is displayed. The
              WD2 event can be reset with OUT_WD2@0 - this also stops the watchdog function. Set watchdog time to m
              (20 - 1,500) seconds, with watchdog time echo. This command launches the watchdog function and must be
              transmitted within the set watchdog time.
