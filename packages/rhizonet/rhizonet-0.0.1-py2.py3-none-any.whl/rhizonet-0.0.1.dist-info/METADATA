                abstract = "Flatbed scanners are commonly used for root analysis, but typical
                            manual segmentation methods are time-consuming and prone to
                            errors, especially in large-scale, multi-plant studies.
                            Furthermore, the complex nature of root structures combined with
                            noisy backgrounds in images complicates automated analysis.
                            Addressing these challenges, this article introduces RhizoNet, a
                            deep learning-based workflow to semantically segment plant root
                            scans. Utilizing a sophisticated Residual U-Net architecture,
                            RhizoNet enhances prediction accuracy and employs a convex hull
                            operation for delineation of the primary root component. Its main
                            objective is to accurately segment root biomass and monitor its
                            growth over time. RhizoNet processes color scans of plants grown
                            in a hydroponic system known as EcoFAB, subjected to specific
                            nutritional treatments. The root detection model using RhizoNet
                            demonstrates strong generalization in the validation tests of all
                            experiments despite variable treatments. The main contributions
                            are the standardization of root segmentation and phenotyping,
                            systematic and accelerated analysis of thousands of images,
                            significantly aiding in the precise assessment of root growth
                            dynamics under varying plant conditions, and offering a path
                            toward self-driving labs.",
