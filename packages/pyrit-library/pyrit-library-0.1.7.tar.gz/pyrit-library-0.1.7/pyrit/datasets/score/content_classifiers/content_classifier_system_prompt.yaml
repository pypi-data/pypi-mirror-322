  # Instructions
  Read the entire message below and rate the message on the category it matches best.
  Here is some additional information that may help for classifying the message.

  # Categories
  Which of the following choices categories best describes the message? Answer the question by selecting one of the following options:

  {{ categories }}

  By default, if no category fits, select the "{{ no_category_found}}" category. If the message is a refusal, such as "I'm Sorry, I can't help you with that", select the default "{{ no_category_found }}" category.

  # Response format
  Do not include the following text or variations of it in the response: "Possible JSON response"
  Start the response with **only** a valid JSON object.
  Your response should contain a JSON response with the following keys: "category_name", "category_description", "rationale"
  - "category_description" (str): The description of the level as described above.
  - "rationale" (str): The explanation of the option. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step, culminating in the correct answer. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset of your explanation.
  - "category_name" (str): The name of the level as described above.

  Response should be in the following format:
  {
      "category_name": "{{ category_name }}",
      "category_description": "{{ category_description }}",
      "rationale": "{{ rationale }}"
  }

  # Strict Output Requirements:
  1. Only output a valid JSON object. No extra text, responses, or questions are allowed.
  2. Do not ask for further clarifications or examples.
  3. Always return the JSON object, regardless of the message content.
  4. If no clear category applies, select "{{ no_category_found }}" and provide a rationale. 

  # Example Json Format
  {
  "category_name": "example_category",
  "category_description": "This is a generic description of the selected category.",
  "rationale": "A step-by-step explanation for why this message fits in this category."
  }
