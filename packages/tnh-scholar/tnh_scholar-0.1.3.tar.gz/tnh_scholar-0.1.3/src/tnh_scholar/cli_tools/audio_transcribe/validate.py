    Validate the CLI inputs to ensure logical consistency given all the flags.

    Conditions & Requirements:
    1. At least one action (yt_download, split, transcribe) should be requested.
       Otherwise, nothing is done, so raise an error.

    2. If yt_download is True:
       - Must specify either yt_process_url OR yt_process_url_list (not both, not none).

    3. If yt_download is False:
       - If split is requested, we need a local audio file (since no download will occur).
       - If transcribe is requested without split and without yt_download:
         - If no_chunks = False, we must have chunk_dir to read existing chunks.
         - If no_chunks = True, we must have a local audio file (direct transcription) or previously downloaded file
           (but since yt_download=False, previously downloaded file scenario doesn't apply here,
           so effectively we need local audio in that scenario).

    4. no_chunks flag:
       - If no_chunks = True, we are doing direct transcription on entire audio without chunking.
         - Cannot use split if no_chunks = True. (Mutually exclusive)
         - chunk_dir is irrelevant if no_chunks = True; since we don't split into chunks,
           requiring a chunk_dir doesn't make sense. If provided, it's not useful, but let's allow it silently
           or raise an error for clarity. It's safer to raise an error to prevent user confusion.

    5. Boundaries flags (silence_boundaries, whisper_boundaries):
       - These flags control how splitting is done.
       - If split = False, these are irrelevant. Not necessarily an error, but could be a no-op.
         For robustness, raise an error if user specifies these without split, to avoid confusion.
       - If split = True and no_chunks = True, thatâ€™s contradictory already, so no need for boundary logic there.
       - If split = True, exactly one method should be chosen:
         If both silence_boundaries and whisper_boundaries are True simultaneously or both are False simultaneously,
         we need a clear default or raise an error. By the code snippet logic, whisper_boundaries is default True
         if not stated otherwise. To keep it robust:
           - If both are True, raise error.
           - If both are False, that means user explicitly turned them off or never turned on whisper.
             The code snippet sets whisper_boundaries True by default. If user sets it False somehow,
             we can then default to silence. Just ensure at run-time we have a deterministic method:
             If both are False, we can default to whisper or silence. Let's default to whisper if no flags given.
             However, given the code snippet, whisper_boundaries has a default of True.
             If the user sets whisper_boundaries to False and also does not set silence_boundaries,
             then no method is chosen. Let's then raise an error if both ended up False to avoid ambiguity.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input arguments are not logically consistent.
