          fs: sampling frequency in Hz (float)
          tau: Time constant in seconds (75us in US, 50us in EUR) (float)

    An analog deemphasis filter:

    o------/\/\/\/---+----o
                     |
                    = C
                     |
                    ---

    Has this transfer function:

                 1             1
                ----          ---
                 RC          tau
    H(s) = ---------- = ----------
                   1             1
              s + ----      s + ---
                   RC           tau

    And has its -3 dB response, due to the pole, at

    |H(j w_c)|^2 = 1/2  =>  s = j w_c = j (1/(RC))

    Historically, this corner frequency of analog audio deemphasis filters
    been specified by the RC time constant used, called tau.
    So w_c = 1/tau.

    FWIW, for standard tau values, some standard analog components would be:
    tau = 75 us = (50K)(1.5 nF) = (50 ohms)(1.5 uF)
    tau = 50 us = (50K)(1.0 nF) = (50 ohms)(1.0 uF)

    In specifying tau for this digital deemphasis filter, tau specifies
    the *digital* corner frequency, w_c, desired.

    The digital deemphasis filter design below, uses the
    "bilinear transformation" method of designing digital filters:

    1. Convert digital specifications into the analog domain, by prewarping
       digital frequency specifications into analog frequencies.

       w_a = (2/T)tan(wT/2)

    2. Use an analog filter design technique to design the filter.

    3. Use the bilinear transformation to convert the analog filter design to a
       digital filter design.

       H(z) = H(s)|
                       s = (2/T)(1-z^-1)/(1+z^-1)


           w_ca         1          1 - (-1) z^-1
    H(z) = ---- * ----------- * -----------------------
           2 fs        -w_ca             -w_ca
                   1 - -----         1 + -----
                        2 fs              2 fs
                                 1 - ----------- z^-1
                                         -w_ca
                                     1 - -----
                                          2 fs

    We use this design technique, because it is an easy way to obtain a filter
    design with the -6 dB/octave roll-off required of the deemphasis filter.
