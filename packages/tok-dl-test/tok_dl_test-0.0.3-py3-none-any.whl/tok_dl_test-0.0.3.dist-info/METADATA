## Features
- Saves both video and gallery posts, including all of their metadata
- Highest quality, no watermarks
- Caches already-downloaded and unavailable posts to avoid fetching them again

## Usage
Tok-DL takes input in the form of newline-separated links. This format is the same as is contained in TikTok personal data downloads. It will ignore commented lines.

```
Usage: tok-dl [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE

  TikTok Archiver

Options:
  -m, --metadata-only     Only download metadata.
  -o, --out DIRECTORY     Output directory. (default ./tiktok)
  -e, --errors-file FILE  File to save errors to. (default ./errors.log)
  --no-cache              Bypass the bad URL cache.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

## Limitations
Since Tok-DL utilizes the [TiKWM](https://www.tikwm.com/) API, there is a limit of 5,000 requests per day, and 1 per second. Tok-DL automatically handles this on a second-by-second basis, but you will begin seeing errors if you hit the daily limit. Thankfully, you can easily pick up where you left off by feeding `errors.log` back in to Tok-DL as an input file.
