      Calculates the illuminance at a given distance from a light source.
    
      This function computes the illuminance (in lux, lm/m²) based on the spectral
      irradiance of a light source (in watts per nanometer, W·nm⁻¹·m⁻²). The
      calculation uses the CIE 1931 standard observer Y data to integrate the
      spectral flux over the visible wavelength range (380 nm to 780 nm).
