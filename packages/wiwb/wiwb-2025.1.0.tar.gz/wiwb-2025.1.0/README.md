# WIWB API
A Python API on the WIWB API. It includes:
- authorization
- get `datasources`
- get `variables`
- get `grids`
- sample `grids` to a set of geometries (points and/or polygons)
- sample existing netcdf files to a set of geometries (points and/or polygons)


## Getting started
Request a wiwb client-id and client-secret. Provide them as `wiwb_client_id` and `wiwb_client_secret` os environment variables for your convenience. Alternatively it can be specified at init.

Import wiwb Api and Auth. GetGrids is not implemented in the Api module (yet) so we import it seperately

```
from wiwb import Auth, Api
```

If you have provided os environment variables, you do not have to specify your `client_id` and `client_secret` init your Api as:

```
api = Api()
```

If you didn't you have to initialize auth manually. Your code looks like:

```
auth = Auth(client_id="your-client-id", client_secret="your-client-secret")
api = Api(auth=auth)
```

## Get sources

Find data_sources. You'll notice `Meteobase.Precipitation` being one of them

```
data_sources = api.get_data_sources()
```

## Get variables
Find variables under `Meteobase.Precipitation`. You'll notice `P` being the only variable:

```
variables = api.get_variables(
    data_source_codes=["Meteobase.Precipitation"]
    )
```

## Get grids
We'll specify a download for WIWB MeteoBase Precipitation. If we don't specify a `bounds` or `geometries`, `GetGrids` will be set for the extent of Water Authority HDSR.

```
grids = api.GetGrids(
    auth=auth,
    base_url=api.base_url,
    data_source_code="Meteobase.Precipitation",
    variable_code="P",
    start_date=date(2018,1,1),
    end_date=date(2018,1,2),
    data_format_code="netcdf4.cf1p6",
)
```

We can write the grids to an output directory. If we don't call `grids.run()` before, it will first request the data at WIWB:

```
grids.to_directory(output_dir="")
```

## Sample grids
Let's sample the grids. We'll first make some geometries and assign it to `grids`:

```
from geopandas import GeoSeries
from shapely.geometry import Point, box

LL_POINT = Point(119865,449665)
UR_POINT = Point(127325,453565)
OTHER_POINT = Point(135125,453394)
POLYGON = box(LL_POINT.x, LL_POINT.y, UR_POINT.x, UR_POINT.y)
GEOSERIES = GeoSeries(
    [LL_POINT,
     UR_POINT,
     OTHER_POINT,
     POLYGON],
     index=["ll_point", "ur_point", "other_point", "polygon"],
     crs=28992
     )

grids.set_geometries(GEOSERIES)
```

Now we sample on geometries. We'll write the result to a CSV.

```
df = grids.sample()
df.to_csv("samples.csv")
```

## Sample existing netcdf files
If you have a directory with netcdf-files you can sample them into one DataFrame. You can slice the NetCDFs using a `start_date` and `end_date`.

In the example below we take a set of Van der Sat soil-moisture as example. NeCDFs with one variable are stored in a directory with a variable name. 
So, netcdfs containing the variable `DRZSM-AMSR2-C1N-DESC-T10_V003_100` are stored in a directory with name `DRZSM-AMSR2-C1N-DESC-T10_V003_100`

```
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import date

START_DATE = date(2015, 1, 1)
END_DATE = date(2015, 1, 2)
DIR = Path("path_to_netcdf_directory")

LL_POINT = Point(119865,449665)
UR_POINT = Point(127325,453565)
OTHER_POINT = Point(135125,453394)
POLYGON = box(LL_POINT.x, LL_POINT.y, UR_POINT.x, UR_POINT.y)
GEOSERIES = GeoSeries(
    [LL_POINT,
     UR_POINT,
     OTHER_POINT,
     POLYGON],
     index=["ll_point", "ur_point", "other_point", "polygon"],
     crs=28992
     )

# get variables from directory names and take the first
variables = [i.name for i in DIR.glob(r"*/")]
variable = variables[0]

# go to the directory with the variable
dir = DIR / variable 

# sample all netcdf's in the directory over the variable
df = sample_nc_dir(dir, variable, GEOSERIES, start_date=START_DATE, end_date=END_DATE)
```

If you wish to specify a list of NetCDF files rather than a directory, you can use:

```
nc_files = [
    dir / "DRZSM-AMSR2-C1N-DESC-T10_V003_100_2015-01-01T000000_4.040000_52.240000_5.600000_51.300000.nc",  # must be pathlib.Path object
    dir / "DRZSM-AMSR2-C1N-DESC-T10_V003_100_2015-01-02T000000_4.040000_52.240000_5.600000_51.300000.nc"  # must be pathlib.Path object
    ]

df = sample_nc_dir(nc_files, variable, GEOSERIES, start_date=START_DATE, end_date=END_DATE)
```
