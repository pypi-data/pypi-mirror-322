## Installation

### Install via PyPI
```bash
pip install fastQpick
```

### Install from Source Code

Using pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pachterlab/fastQpick.git
```

Or clone the repository and build manually:

## Usage

### Command-line Interface

Run `fastQpick` with a specified fraction and options:
```bash
fastQpick --fraction FRACTION [OPTIONS] FASTQ_FILE1 FASTQ_FILE2 ...
```

### Python API

Use `fastQpick` in your Python code:
```python
from fastQpick import fastQpick

fastQpick(
    input_file_list=['FASTQ_FILE1', 'FASTQ_FILE2', ...],
    fraction=FRACTION,
    ...
)
```

## Documentation

- **Command-line Help**: Use the following command to see all available options:
  ```bash
  fastQpick --help
  ```

- **Python API Help**: Use the `help` function to explore the API:
  ```python
  help(fastQpick)
  ```

### Options
- input_files (str, list, or tuple)        List of input FASTQ files or directories containing FASTQ files. Required. Positional argument on command line.
-  fraction (int or float)                 The fraction of reads to sample, as a float greater than 0. Any value equal to or greater than 1 will turn on the -r flag automatically.
-  seed (int or str)                       Random seed(s). Can provide multiple seeds separated by commas. Default: 42
-  output_dir (str)                        Output directory. Default: ./fastQpick_output
-  gzip_output (bool)                      Whether or not to gzip the output. Default: False (uncompressed)
-  group_size (int)                        The size of grouped files. Provide each pair of files sequentially, separated by a space. E.g., I1, R1, R2 -  would have group_size=3. Default: 1 (unpaired)
-  replacement (bool)                      Sample with replacement. Default: False (without replacement).
-  overwrite (bool)                        Overwrite existing output files. Default: False
-  low_memory (bool)                       Whether to use low memory mode (uses ~5.5x less memory than default, but adds marginal time to the data -  structure generation preprocessing). Default: False
-  verbose (bool)                          Whether to print progress information. Default: True

## Features

- Efficient sampling of large FASTQ files.
- Works with both single and paired-end sequencing data.
- Supports sampling with or without replacement.
- Command-line interface and Python API for seamless integration.
- Memory efficient - in low-memory mode, only uses as much memory as a list of (small) integers the length of the number of reads in the fastq file for each file.
- Time efficient - only passes through the fastq once and writes to output in batches - can process 600M reads in 10-15 minutes

## Low memory mode vs. standard
Low memory mode vs. standard, when fraction=1 (i.e., number of reads to sample is the same as the number of reads in the fastq):
- Adds an extra ~1-3 seconds per million reads per group_size (i.e., 500M reads would take 30 minutes instead of 20-25 minutes)
- Saves an extra ~40MB RAM per million reads (i.e., 500M reads would take 3.75GB RAM vs 20.6GB RAM)

## Examples

### 1. Sample 10% of reads with replacement from a FASTQ file:

**Command-line**
```bash
fastQpick --fraction 0.1 -r input.fastq
```

**Python**
```python
from fastQpick import fastQpick

fastQpick(
    input_files='input.fastq',
    fraction=0.1,
    replacement=True
)
```

### 2. Sample 100% of reads with replacement from multiple paired FASTQ files (R1, R2) across three seeds (i.e., bootstrapping):

**Command-line**
```bash
fastQpick --fraction 1 -s 42,43,44 -r -g 2 input1_R1.fastq input1_R2.fastq
```

**Python**
```python
from fastQpick import fastQpick

fastQpick(
    input_files='input.fastq',
    fraction=1,
    seed="42,43,44",
    replacement=True,
    group_size=2,
)
```
