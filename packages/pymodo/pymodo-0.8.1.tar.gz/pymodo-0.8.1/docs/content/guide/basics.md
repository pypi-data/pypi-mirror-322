## Installation

### Using Python

ModoðŸ§¯ is available on PyPI as [`pymodo`](https://pypi.org/project/pymodo/).
Install it with pip:

```
pip install pymodo
```

> This installs the `modo` command. If the command is not found, try:  
> `python -m pymodo`

### Using Go

With [Go](https://go.dev) installed, you can install ModoðŸ§¯ like this:
```shell
go install github.com/mlange-42/modo@latest
```

### Precompiled binaries

Pre-compiled binaries for manual installation are available in the
[Releases](https://github.com/mlange-42/modo/releases)
for Linux, Windows and MacOS.

## Usage

In your MojoðŸ”¥ project, set up ModoðŸ§¯:

```shell {class="no-wrap"}
modo init
```

This sets up the project with default settings and paths.
See the generated `modo.yaml` file to modify them.

Next, run `mojo doc` to extract the API docs in JSON format:

```shell {class="no-wrap"}
mojo doc src/ -o api.json
```

Finally, build the Markdown documentation:

```shell {class="no-wrap"}
modo build
```
