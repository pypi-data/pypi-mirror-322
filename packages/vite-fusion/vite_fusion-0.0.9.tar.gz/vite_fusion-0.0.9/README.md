## Installation

On your Python interpreter `pip install vite-fusion` then:

1. Install the required dependencies for Flask and Vite.
2. Copy the `register_vite_assets` function into your project.

---

## Usage

After initializing your Flask application, call the `register_vite_assets` function to integrate Vite assets.

### Example Usage:

```python
from vite_fusion import register_vite_assets

app = Flask(__name__)

register_vite_assets(
    app,
    dev_mode=True,
    dev_server_url="http://localhost:5173",
    manifest_path="src/dist/.vite/manifest.json",
    nonce_provider=my_nonce_provider,  # Optional
    logger=my_logger                   # Optional
)
```

## manifest.json in dev mode?

Although accessing the `manifest.json` file in development mode is not a common practice, we concluded that searching for and loading files directly from it in development mode, without needing to set up an array of files, is the most appropriate approach. As a result, the `manifest.json` file must be available in both development and production environments. This is why we recommend running npm run build before starting to use this integration.

---

## Examples

### Registering Vite Assets in Development Mode

```python
register_vite_assets(
    app,
    dev_mode=True,
    dev_server_url="http://localhost:5173",
    manifest_path="src/dist/.vite/manifest.json"
)
```

### Registering Vite Assets in Production Mode

```python
register_vite_assets(
    app,
    dev_mode=False,
    dev_server_url="http://localhost:5173",
    dist_path="/src/dist"
    manifest_path="src/dist/.vite/manifest.json",
    nonce_provider=my_nonce_provider
)
```

or

```python
register_vite_assets(
    homedock_www,
    dev_mode=False,
    dev_server_url="http://localhost:5173",
    dist_path="/src/dist"
    manifest_path="src/dist/.vite/manifest.json",
    nonce_provider=nonce_value,
    logger=None
)
```

## How can I make it work?

Ensure that Flask is set up to serve the directories and files Vite needs to load. This includes the `static` folder during development and the `dist` folder for production. You can do this by adding the following code to your Flask app:

```python

from flask import send_from_directory

def send_src_static(path):
    return send_from_directory(os.path.join(app.root_path, "src", "static"), path)

def send_src_dist(path):
    return send_from_directory(os.path.join(app.root_path, "src", "dist"), path)
```

This makes Flask capable of serving files from your `./src` folder. (Make sure it fits your dist_path)

Update your `vite.config.js` to look something like this:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { resolve } from "path";

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    outDir: "src/dist",
    manifest: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        global: resolve(__dirname, "src/static/css/global.css"),
        anyOtherCSSFile: resolve(__dirname, "src/static/css/otherCSS.css"),
        mainfileExample: resolve(__dirname, "src/static/js/mainfile_example.js"),
        externalImportsExample: resolve(__dirname, "src/static/js/externalImports_example.js"),
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The `manifest: true` setting is critical. After configuring it, run an initial build to generate the `manifest.json`. This manifest maps your assets to the correct files, ensuring Flask knows how to locate them.

For development mode, make sure `manifest.json` is also accessible, as it’s required for Vite Hot Reloading (HR) and file resolution through vite-fusion. Without the manifest, Flask won't be able to locate the correct files, even in development.

The same logic used for JavaScript file injection applies to CSS files. Ensure they are also ingested through the manifest.

After that you will be able to load Vite generated assets on your Jinja2 templates such as this:

```jinja2
{{ vitecss("global") | safe }}
{{ vitecss("anyOtherCSSFile") | safe }}
{{ vitejs("mainfileExample") | safe }}
{{ vitejs("externalImportsExample") | safe }}
```

Works properly with Vue, React, Tailwind etc...

## About This Integration

This integration was heavily inspired by **Laravel-Vite-Plugin**. While it may not be as feature-rich, it was designed to deliver a similar functionality and workflow tailored for **HomeDock OS**, one of our Python projects. HomeDock OS is a robust and versatile platform for home automation and cloud management. Learn more at [homedock.cloud](https://www.homedock.cloud).

***It's time to stop relegating the backend to being just an API. With integrations like this, we can truly unlock a seamless and efficient full-stack experience, with proper collaboration between frontend and backend development.***
