# Setup Instructions

Before running the Herd gRPC client, you need to copy your CA certificate, Server certificate, and Server key into the `certs` directory. Ensure the following files are present in the `certs` directory:

- `ca.crt`
- `server.crt`
- `server.key`

These certificates are required for establishing a secure gRPC connection.
