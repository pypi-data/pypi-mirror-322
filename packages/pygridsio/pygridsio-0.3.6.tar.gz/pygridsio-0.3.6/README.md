# pygridsio



## Introduction

This is a python submodule containing IO functionality for reading and writing .asc and .zmap grids.

## Usage

`from pygridsio.pygridsio import *`
The standard grid class used throughout this project is an Xarray DataArray (see: https://xarray.dev/) with 2 dimensions: x and y.

To read a grid file to this class use:
`grid = read_grid(filename)`

To read a grid to the custom grid class use (To be depreciated in version 4.0.0):
`grid = read_grid_to_custom_grid(filename)`

When writing out grids, you can write out grids to a netcdf raster (.nc) which can be read easily by xarray, or QGIS or ArcGIS, .asc and .zmap are also supported:
`write_grid(grid,filename)`
The code will discern which filetype to write out to by the file extension in filename.

There is some plotting functionality built into pygridsio using the `pygridsio.grid_plotting` module:
The method `pygridsio.grid_plotting.plot_grid` allows you to plot a custom Grid class, or xr.DataArray with multiple options. See the description of the method for more detail.
The method `pygridsio.grid_plotting.plotplot_grid_comparison` Creates a plot comparing two grids values against eachother. See the description of the method for more detail.

## Installation to Develop the code further

### Anaconda
#### Create/update anaconda environment
The file `environment.yml` can be used to create a working development python environment with the needed packages.
For this open an `Anaconda Prompt` and:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Or to update the existing anaconda environment (with an updated version of the`environment.yml`file :

`conda env update -n pygridsio -f environment.yml`

#### Export (updated) anaconda environment
The `environment.yml` file needs to be updated when new packages are added:

`conda env export --from-history -n pygridsio > environment.yml`

#### Use anaconda environment in PyCharm
To connect the anaconda environment to Pycharm you can go to `File` , `Settings`, `Project`, `Python Interpreter`, `add interpreter`, `add local interpreter`, `conda environment` and then select the environment you created using the above steps.

### Poetry
Poetry is becoming the new way to manage your python projects and dependencies. Install poetry here: https://python-poetry.org/docs/ 
(note: if you can't run poetry from your terminal, ensure that the poetry.exe is in your environment variables).

Then after cloning this repo to your local machine, run:
`poetry install`

Which will install a virtual environment in the gitlab repo. This can also be done using the Pycharm Python Interpreter interface.

### Verify Installation
You can verify the installation of the different python packages by running the tests stored in `tests`. 
In pycharm: Right click on the folder marked `tests` and click on `Run python tests in test`

## publishing the project to ci.tno.nl/gitlab
To publish an updated version of the project to the pygridsio package registry I recommend using poetry.

First configure the connection between poetry and the gitlab package registry:
`poetry config repositories.gitlab_pygridsio https://ci.tno.nl/gitlab/api/v4/projects/17422/packages/pypi`

Add your own personal access token details (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html):
`poetry publish --repository gitlab_pygridsio -u"token name" -p "token value"`

Then you can build and publish the project as a new deployment in the package registry:
`poetry build`
`poetry publish`
(make sure the version number you publish is unique)

## How to import pygridsio into other python projects

### Pip

You can use pip to get the most up to date version of pygridsio:
`pip install pygridsio`
