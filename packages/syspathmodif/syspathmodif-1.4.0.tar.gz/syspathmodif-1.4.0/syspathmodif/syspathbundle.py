class SysPathBundle:
	"""
	Upon instantiation, a bundle stores several paths and adds them to list
	sys.path. When a bundle is cleared, it erases its content and removes it
	from sys.path. Thus, this class facilitates adding and removing a group of
	paths.

	This class is a context manager. If a bundle is used in a with statement as
	in the following example, it is cleared at the block's end.

	with SysPathBundle(("path/to/module", "path/to/package")):
	
	The constructor can set a bundle to be cleared by the destructor. This
	should not be done for a bundle used as a context manager as exiting the
	with block clears the bundle anyway.
