                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This module finds a non-euclidean distance or similarity between two strings.

Jaro and [Jaro-Winkler](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/1991/adrm/rr91-9.pdf) equations provides a score between two short strings where errors are more prone at the end of the string. Jaro's equation measure is the weighted sum of the percentage of matching and transposed characters from each string. Winkler's factor adds weight in Jaro's formula to increase the calculated measure when there is a sequence of characters (a prefix) in both strings.

This version is based on the [original C implementation of strcmp95](https://web.archive.org/web/20100227020019/http://www.census.gov/geo/msb/stand/strcmp.c) implementation but does not attempt to normalize characters that are similar to the eyes (e.g.: `O` vs `0`).

 * Impact of the prefix is limited to 4 characters, as originally defined by Winkler.
 * Input strings are not modified beyond whitespace trimming.
 * In-word whitespace and characters case will **optionally** impact score.
 * Returns a floating point number rounded to the desired decimals (defaults to `2`) using Python's [`round`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round).
 * Consider usual [floating point arithmetic](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html#tut-fp-issues) characteristics when working with this module.

## Implementation

The complexity of this algoritme resides in finding the `matching` and `transposed` characters. That is because of the interpretation of what are the `matching` conditions and the definition of `transposed`. Definitions of those two will make the score vary between implementations of this algorithme.

Here is how `matching` and `transposed` are defined in this module:

* A character of the first string at position `N` is `matching` if found at position `N` or within `distance` on either side in the second string.
* The `distance` is calculated using the rounded down length of the longest string divided by two minus one.
* Characters in the first string are matched only once against characters of the second string.
* Two characters are `transposed` if they previously matched and aren't at the same position in the matching character subset.
* Decimals are rounded according to the scientific method.

**TODO**: Implementation should be refactored to use Python's [Decimal](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/decimal.html) module from the standard library. This module was introduced in Python 3.9.

### Example

Calculate the Jaro Winkler similarity ($sim_{w}$) between `PENNSYLVANIA` and `PENNCISYLVNIA`:

$$
s_{1}=\text{PENNSYLVANIA} \qquad\text{and}\qquad s_{2}=\text{PENNCISYLVNIA}
$$

```
    P E N N C I S Y L V N I A
  ┌-─────────────────────────
P │ 1          ╎
E │   1          ╎
N │     1          ╎
N │       1          ╎           Symbols '╎' represent the sliding windows
S │             1      ╎        boundary in the second string where we look
Y │ ╎             1      ╎           for the first string's character.
L │   ╎             1      ╎
V │     ╎             1                   d = 5 in this example.
A │       ╎                 1
N │         ╎           1
I │           ╎           1
A │             ╎
```

$$
\begin{split}
   d &= \left\lfloor {\max(12, 13) \over 2} \right\rfloor - 1 \newline
     &= 5 \newline
\end{split}
\qquad
   \text{ and }
\qquad
\begin{split}
   |s_{1}| &= 12 \newline
   |s_{2}| &= 13 \newline
\end{split}
\qquad
   \text{ and }
\qquad
\begin{split}
   \ell &= 4 \newline
      m &= 11 \newline
      t &= 3 \newline
      p &= 0.1 \newline
\end{split}
$$

Considering the input parameters calculated above:

$$
\begin{split}
   sim_{j} &=\begin{cases}
               0 & \text{if } m = 0 \newline
               {1 \over 3} \times \left({m \over |s_{1}|} + {m \over |s_{2}|} + {{m - t} \over m} \right) & \text{otherwise}
             \end{cases} \newline
           &={1 \over 3} \times \left({11 \over 12} + {11 \over 13} + {{11 - 3} \over 11}\right) \newline
           &= 0.83003108003 \newline
\end{split}
\qquad
   \text{then}
\qquad
\begin{split}
   sim_{w} &= sim_{j} + \ell \times p \times (1 - sim_{j}) \newline
           &= 0.83003108003 + 4 \times 0.1 \times (1 - 0.83003108003) \newline
           &= 0.89801864801 \newline
\end{split}
$$

We found that the $\lceil sim_{w} \rceil$ is $0.9$.

## Usage

```python
from pyjarowinkler import distance

distance.get_jaro_similarity("PENNSYLVANIA", "PENNCISYLVNIA", decimals=12)
# 0.830031080031
distance.get_jaro_winkler_similarity("PENNSYLVANIA", "PENNCISYLVNIA", decimals=12)
# 0.898018648019
distance.get_jaro_distance("hello", "haloa", decimals=4)
# 0.2667
distance.get_jaro_similarity("hello", "haloa", decimals=2)
# 0.73
distance.get_jaro_winkler_distance("hello", "Haloa", scaling=0.1, ignore_case=False)
# 0.4
distance.get_jaro_winkler_distance("hello", "HaLoA", scaling=0.1, ignore_case=True)
# 0.24
distance.get_jaro_winkler_similarity("hello", "haloa", decimals=2)
