    An object that implements the spectral constraint objective.

    Methods
    -------
    dftmtx()
            A method that returns the DFT matrix (unnormalised) by 1/sqrt(N).

    decompose_DFT()
            A method that decomposes the unnormalised DFT matrix into the real and
            imaginary matrices R and I.

    Hadamard_product(A, x)
            A method that computes the Hadamard product for the matrix-vector product
            v = A @ x. This returns v * v (elementwise product)

    Hadamard_derivative(A, x)
            A method that computes the Hadamard product derivative w.r.t the x
            vector. d/dx(v * v) = 2 * diag(A @ x) @ A

    check_w_want(w1)
            This method checks whether the vector that we compare to (w1) is suitable.
            It allows for either a Nx1 vector or a MxN matrix.

    Xw(Re, Im, w)
            This method computes the squared complex modulus of the Fourier
            vector F(w). The returned vector is normalised by 1/N. It accounts for
            the shape of w, to allow for a w to either be a Nx1 vector or a MxN matrix
            for M vectors w.

    spectral_loss(w, w1)
            This method returns the loss function for the spectral constraint.
            It computes the dot product between the Fourier representation of w
            and the Fourier representation/representations of the vector/vectors
            in w1. The resulting shape of the loss is either a 1x1 vector or a
            Mx1 vector (depending on whether w is a vector or matrix of vectors)

    spectral_derivative(w, w1)
            This method computes the first derivative (gradient) of the spectral loss
            w.r.t the w parameters. It returns a Nx1 vector of parameters
            or a NxM matrix of M gradient vectors.

    spectral_hessian(w, w1)
            This method computes the second derivative (Hessian) of the spectral loss
            w.r.t the w parameters. it either returns a NxN vector of parameters
            of a MxNxN matrix of M Hessians.

                instance after it has been calculated.

        inv_hessian_flag: bool
