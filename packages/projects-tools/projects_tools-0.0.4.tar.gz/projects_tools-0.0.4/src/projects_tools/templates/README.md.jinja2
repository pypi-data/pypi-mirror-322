# {{ project_name }}

This project is built with:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Python

## Development Setup

### Frontend Development

The frontend is set up with the following tech stack:
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- React Router DOM (v6)

To set up the frontend development environment:

```bash
make ts
```

This will:
1. Create a new React+TypeScript project
2. Install necessary dependencies
3. Configure TailwindCSS
4. Set up initial project structure

### Backend Development

The backend is a Python package that serves the frontend as static files.

### Building and Publishing

To build and publish the project:

```bash
make release
```

This will:
1. Build the frontend
2. Package static files
3. Build Python package
4. Publish to PyPI (if in release mode)
