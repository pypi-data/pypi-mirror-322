### Key Updates:
1. **Installation Section**:
   - Added a note about `mysql-connector-python` as a dependency and how it will be automatically installed with `ncert_learn`.
   - Provided instructions for manual installation of `mysql-connector-python`.
   - Added the option for using a `requirements.txt` file.
   
2. **Usage Section**:
   - You may want to provide an example of using MySQL with Python (via `mysql-connector-python`), but this would depend on your specific use case.

This update helps users understand the new MySQL dependency and makes it easier for them to install all necessary requirements.
