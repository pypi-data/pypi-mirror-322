Convoys2
=======

![pic](docs/images/dob-violations-combined.png)

Convoys is a simple library that fits a few statistical model useful for modeling time-lagged conversions.
There is a lot more info if you head over to the  [documentation](https://better.engineering/convoys/).
You can also take a look at [this blog post](https://better.engineering/2019/07/29/modeling-conversion-rates-and-saving-millions-of-dollars-using-kaplan-meier-and-gamma-distributions/) about Convoys.

Installation
------------

You can install from PyPI using any compatible tool (pip, uv, poetry, etc.):

```bash
pip install convoys2
```

You can then import the package using the name `convoys`:

```py
import convoys
```
