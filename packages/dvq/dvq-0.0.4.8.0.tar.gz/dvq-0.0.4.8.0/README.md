# DVQ - DNA Visualisations and Quick comparisons 
Abstract
We introduce DVQ (DNA Visualisations and Quick comparisons), an open-source Python library for exploring nucleotide sequences using a variety of methods. Understanding DNA sequences intuitively isimportant for a variety of tasks in biology. DVQ aims to be a one-stop comprehensive library that makes explainable DNA easy for geneticists, researchers, and practitioners who need explanations. For practitioners, the library provides an easy-to-use interface to generate visualisations for their sequencesby only writing a few lines of code. In this report, we demonstrate several example use cases across different types of sequences as well as visualisations.

## Overview:

* How to use dvq
```python
from dvq import visual

visual.plot_2d_comparison([seqs_1, seqs_2], ['seq_1', 'seq_2'])

```

```python
from dvq import statistical

statistical.similarity_wen([seqs_1, seqs_2])
# 0.99

```
