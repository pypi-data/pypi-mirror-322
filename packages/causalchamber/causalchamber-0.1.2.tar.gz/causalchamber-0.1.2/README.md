# The Causal Chambers: Dataset Repository

![The Causal Chambers: (left) the wind tunnel, and (right) the light tunnel with the front panel removed to show its interior.](https://causalchamber.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/downloadables/the_chambers.jpg)

This repository contains datasets collected from the _causal chambers_, the two devices described in the 2024 paper [*The Causal Chambers: Real Physical Systems as a Testbed for AI Methodology*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11341.pdf) by Juan L. Gamella, Jonas Peters and Peter Bühlmann. The repository is updated as we collect new datasets from the chambers.

The datasets are publicly available through a permissive [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This means you are free to use, share and modify the datasets as long as you give appropriate credit and communicate changes. If you use the datasets in your scientific work, please consider citing:

This repository also contains the source code for the `causalchamber` [package](https://pypi.org/project/causalchamber/) to directly [import the datasets into your Python code](#downloading-the-datasets). The package also provides Python implementations of the [mechanistic models](#mechanistic-models) described in appendix IV of the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11341.pdf).

Here you can also find the resources to build the chambers (see [`hardware/`](hardware/)).

The code to reproduce the case studies in the original paper can be found in the separate [paper repository](https://github.com/juangamella/causal-chamber-paper).

## Downloading the datasets

For each dataset, you can simply download a `.zip` file with all the data, including the images at different resolutions. The link and checksum (to verify integrity) are available on the page of each dataset (click on the dataset name in the table above).

If you use Python, you can directly import a dataset into your code through the `causalchamber` [package](https://pypi.org/project/causalchamber/). You can install it using pip, e.g. by typing

```
pip install causalchamber
```

in an appropriate shell. Datasets can then be accessed directly from your Python code. For example, you can access the light-intensity data for the symbolic regression case study ([Fig. 6e](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11341.pdf)) as follows:

```python
from causalchamber.datasets import Dataset

# Download the dataset and store it, e.g., in the current directory
dataset = Dataset(name='lt_malus_v1', root='./', download=True)

# Select an experiment and load its observations
experiment = dataset.get_experiment(name='white_255')
df = experiment.as_pandas_dataframe()
```

For the available experiment names, see the page for each dataset (click on the dataset name in the table above) or run
```python
dataset.available_experiments()

# Output:
# ['blue_128',
#  'blue_255',
#  'blue_64',
#  'green_128',
#  'green_255',
#  'green_64',
#  'red_128',
#  'red_255',
#  'red_64',
#  'white_128',
#  'white_255',
#  'white_64']
```

## Mechanistic models

The `causalchamber` [package](https://pypi.org/project/causalchamber/) also contains Python implementations of the mechanistic models described in appendix IV of the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11341.pdf). The models follow the same nomenclature as in the paper, e.g., to import and run model A1 of the steady-state fan speed:
```Python
import numpy as np
from causalchamber.models import model_a1
model_a1(L=np.linspace(0,1,10), L_min=0.1, omega_max=314.15)

# Output:

# array([ 31.415     ,  34.90555556,  69.81111111, 104.71666667,
#        139.62222222, 174.52777778, 209.43333333, 244.33888889,
#        279.24444444, 314.15      ])
```

The implementations can be found in the [`src/causalchamber/models`](src/causalchamber/models) directory. You can find examples of using the models in the [`case_studies/mechanistic_models.ipynb`](https://github.com/juangamella/causal-chamber-paper/blob/main/case_studies/mechanistic_models.ipynb) notebook in the separate [paper repository](https://github.com/juangamella/causal-chamber-paper).

## Causal ground-truth graphs

The graphs for the causal ground truths given in Fig. 3 of the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11341.pdf) can be found as adjacency matrices in  the [`ground_truths/`](ground_truths/) directory. The adjacencies can also be loaded through the `causalchamber` [package](https://pypi.org/project/causalchamber/), e.g., 
```python
from causalchamber.ground_truth import graph
graph(chamber="lt", configuration="standard")

# Output:

#              red  green  blue  osr_c  v_c  current  pol_1  pol_2  osr_angle_1  \
# red            0      0     0      0    0        1      0      0            0   
# green          0      0     0      0    0        1      0      0            0   
# blue           0      0     0      0    0        1      0      0            0   
# osr_c          0      0     0      0    0        1      0      0            0   
```

To make it easier to plot graphs and reference them back to the original paper, the latex representation of each variable can be obtained by calling the `latex_name` function. For example, to obtain the latex representation $\theta_1$ of the `pol_1` variable, you can run
```python
from causalchamber.ground_truth import latex_name
latex_name('pol_1', enclose=True)

# Output:

# '$\\theta_1$'
```

Setting `enclose=False` will return the name without surrounding `$`.
