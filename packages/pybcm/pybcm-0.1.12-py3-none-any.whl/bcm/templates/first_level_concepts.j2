## Generate Top-Level Concepts for {{ organisation_name }}

Based on the description of {{ organisation_name }} provided below, generate a set of **{{first_level}}** top-level concepts. These concepts should represent the primary categories or groupings within the domain, be distinct from each other, and collectively form a cohesive foundation for further exploration or subdivision into deeper levels of detail.

**Domain Description:**

{{ organisation_description }}

**Instructions:**

For each top-level concept identified, provide:
1. **Name:** A concise, descriptive name that clearly communicates the concept's focus.
2. **Description:** A two-paragraph, domain-oriented explanation in markdown format that outlines the conceptâ€™s scope, purpose, intended outcomes, and relevance. Ensure the description is understandable to both domain experts and non-experts.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Focus on Conceptual Coverage:** Structure the concepts around the core topics or themes in the domain, capturing the essential areas that users or stakeholders would need to understand.
2. **Limit the Number:** Aim for **{{first_level}}** top-level concepts to avoid overcomplicating the model at its highest level.
3. **Coverage:** Ensure that all critical themes, functions, or activities in the domain are accounted for and that each concept is necessary for a holistic understanding.
4. **Ensure Clarity and Distinctness:** Each top-level concept should be uniquely defined and represent a separate area of focus, avoiding overlap or duplication. Use clear, specific language to describe each concept.
5. **Consider Future Expansion:** Plan for deeper levels of detail. The model should be adaptable to future changes, additional categories, and evolving needs.
6. **MECE Principle:** Keep concepts mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE). They should be distinct enough to stand independently but collectively define the domain's key elements.
7. **Provide Context:** Offer a two-paragraph explanation in markdown format of each concept to ensure clarity and context for all stakeholders.
