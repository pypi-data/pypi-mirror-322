# PyBCM - Python Business Capability Modeler

> **NOTICE:** The `pybcm-noai` branch does not include built-in LLM generation or chat features, and AI-powered capability generation is supported exclusively through smart copy/paste features, allowing integration with browser-based AI chat agents like ChatGPT. If you do not have access to common API powered LLM services supported by PydanticAI, then choose the `pybcm-noai` branch. 

**PyBCM** is a powerful and user-friendly Business Capability Modeling (BCM) application built with Python. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for creating, visualizing, and managing hierarchical business capability models. This tool is designed to help business architects, analysts, and strategists map and understand their organization's capabilities effectively.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11 or higher
*   `uv` package manager (recommended for faster dependency management)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pybcm.git
    cd pybcm
    ```

2. **Install dependencies using `uv`:**

    ```bash
    uv pip install -e .
    ```

3. **Alternative: Run as a uv tool:**

    You can install bcm directly as a uv tool:

    ```bash
    uv tool install pybcm
    bcm
    ```

4. **Updating the Project:**

    To update PyBCM to the latest version from GitHub:

    1. Navigate to your local repository:
       ```bash
       cd path/to/pybcm
       ```
    
    2. Pull the latest changes:
       ```bash
       git pull origin master
       ```
    
    3. Update dependencies:
       ```bash
       uv pip install -e .
       ```
    
    Note: Before updating, it's recommended to:
    - Back up your `.pybcm` directory in case you've made custom template modifications
    - Check the release notes on GitHub for any breaking changes
    - Export your capability models if you want to be extra cautious

5. **Configure LLM API Keys:**

    PyBCM uses PydanticAI to interact with various LLM providers. You'll need to:

    1. Copy the sample environment file to your user directory:
       ```bash
       mkdir -p ~/.pybcm
       cp .env.sample ~/.pybcm/.env
       ```
    2. Edit `~/.pybcm/.env` and configure your environment:

       Required variables:
       - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required for default setup)

       Optional LLM providers:
       - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For Claude models
       - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: For Gemini models
       - `GROQ_API_KEY`: For Groq models
       - `MISTRAL_API_KEY`: For Mistral models

       Model settings:
       - `DEFAULT_MODEL`: Model to use (default: gpt-4-turbo-preview)
       - `MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum response length (default: 2000)
       - `TEMPERATURE`: Response creativity 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.7)

       See the [Logfire documentation](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/reference/configuration/#using-environment-variables) for setting environment variables for logging.
    
    The application validates these settings on startup and will show an error if required variables are missing.

6. **Configure Logfire logging (first time only):**

    PyBCM uses Logfire for advanced logging and monitoring. On first run, you'll need to:

    1. Create a Logfire account at [logfire.pydantic.dev](https://logfire.pydantic.dev)
    2. Install the Logfire CLI:
       ```bash
       uv pip install logfire
       ```
    3. Authenticate with Logfire:
       ```bash
       logfire auth
       ```
    4. Create and select a project:
       ```bash
       logfire projects new pybcm
       logfire projects use pybcm
       ```

    This only needs to be done once. Credentials are stored in `~/.logfire/default.toml`.

### User Directory and Template Customization

PyBCM creates a `.pybcm` directory in your home folder to store user-specific data and customizations:

```
~/.pybcm/
├── .env              # Environment configuration
├── settings.json     # User settings  
├── templates/        # Customizable templates
│   ├── chat.html            # Chat interface template
│   ├── expansion_prompt.j2  # AI capability expansion prompt
│   ├── first_level_prompt.j2# First-level capabilities prompt
│   └── system_prompt.j2     # AI system prompt
```

#### Template Customization

You can customize how PyBCM generates capabilities and displays the chat interface by modifying the templates in `~/.pybcm/templates/`:

1. **AI Prompts:**
   - `expansion_prompt.j2`: Customize how the AI generates sub-capabilities
   - `first_level_prompt.j2`: Modify the prompt for generating first-level capabilities
   - `system_prompt.j2`: Adjust the AI system prompt for better domain-specific responses

2. **Chat Interface:**
   - `chat.html`: Customize the appearance and behavior of the AI chat interface

The application will:
1. Create these templates automatically on first run
2. Use your customized versions if they exist
3. Fall back to the built-in templates if a customized version doesn't exist

You can select which templates to use for different operations through the Settings dialog:
1. Open Settings (File > Settings)
2. Go to the "AI Generation" tab
3. Choose templates from the dropdown menus:
   - "First-level generation template": Template for generating initial capabilities
   - "Normal generation template": Template for expanding existing capabilities

This allows you to:
- Tailor the AI prompts for your specific industry or use case
- Customize the chat interface appearance
- Experiment with different prompt strategies
- Switch between different prompt templates without editing files
- Maintain multiple template versions for different use cases
- Maintain your customizations across application updates
