## Generate First-Level Capabilities for {{ organisation_name }}

Based on the description of {{ organisation_name }} provided below, generate a set of {{first_level}} first-level business capabilities. These capabilities should represent the core functions of the organization, be distinct from each other, and align with the organization's value chain.

**Organization Description:**

{{ organisation_description }}

**Instructions:**
For each first-level capability identified, provide:
1. **Name:** A concise and descriptive name that clearly communicates the capability's focus.
2. **Description:** A two paragraph, business-oriented explanation in markdown format that outlines the capability's scope, purpose, intended outcomes, and alignment with the overall business capability. Ensure the description is understandable to both business and technical stakeholders.

**Guidelines:**

* **Focus on the Value Chain:**  Structure the capabilities around the primary activities that create value for {{ organisation_name }}'s customers. Consider the flow of value from the initial input to the final delivery of products or services.
* **Limit the Number:** Aim for {{first_level}} first-level capabilities to avoid overcomplicating the model.
* **Coverage:** Make sure to cover all activities that are essential for {{ organisation_name }} to achieve its strategic objectives.
* **Ensure Clarity and Distinctness:** Each capability should be clearly defined and represent a unique functional area of the organization. Use specific and unambiguous language to describe each capability.
* **Consider Future Needs:** Consider not only the current state of the organization but also its future aspirations and strategic direction. The model should be adaptable to future changes and needs.
* **MECE Principle:** Ensure capabilities are mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE). They should be distinct enough to stand independently but collectively define the functional value streams.
* **Provide Context:** Offer a two paragraph explanation in markdown format of each capability to provide context and clarity.
