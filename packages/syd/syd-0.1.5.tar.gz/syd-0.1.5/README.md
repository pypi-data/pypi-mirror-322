A package to help you share your data!

Have you ever wanted to look through all your data really quickly interactively? Of course you have. Mo data mo problems, but only if you don't know what to do with it. And that starts with looking at your data. And that's why syd stands for show your data! 

Syd is a system for creating a data viewing GUI that you can view on a web-browser. And guess what? Since it opens on a web browser, you can even open it on any other computer on your local network! For example, your PI. Gone are the days of single random examples that they make infinitely stubborn conclusions about. Now, you can look at all the examples, quickly and easily, on their computer. And that's why syd stands for share your data!

Okay, so what is it? Syd is an automated system to convert some basic python plotting code into an interactive GUI. This is great, because it means you only have to think about what you want to plot and what you want to be interactive, syd does the work to make an interface. There's some small overhead for learning how to prepare your data to work with syd, but we provide some templates to make it easy. You know what that means? That means you get to focus on _thinking_ about your data, rather than spending time writing code to look at it. And that's why syd stands for Science, Yes! Datum!
