# Explain or debug LLM based metrics using tracing

While evaluating using LLM based metrics, each metric may make one or more calls to the LLM. These traces are important to understand the results of the metrics and to debug any issues.
This notebook demonstrates how to export the LLM traces and analyze them.

## Evaluation
Do a sample evaluation using one of the LLM based metrics.


```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from ragas import EvaluationDataset
from ragas import evaluate
from ragas.metrics._aspect_critic import AspectCriticWithReference

dataset = load_dataset("explodinggradients/amnesty_qa", "english_v3")


eval_dataset = EvaluationDataset.from_hf_dataset(dataset["eval"])

metric = AspectCriticWithReference(
    name="answer_correctness",
    definition="is the response correct compared to reference",
)

results = evaluate(eval_dataset[:5], metrics=[metric])
```
Output
```
Repo card metadata block was not found. Setting CardData to empty.
Evaluating: 100%|██████████| 5/5 [00:02<00:00,  2.12it/s]
```

## Export LLM traces


```python
results.traces
```
Output
```
[{'answer_correctness': 1},
    {'answer_correctness': 0},
    {'answer_correctness': 0},
    {'answer_correctness': 0},
    {'answer_correctness': 0}]
```


Each of these are [`MetricTrace`][ragas.callbacks.MetricTrace] objects that contain the following fields:
- The input to the prompt 
- The output from the model

Both as pydantic objects.

To view this you can select the index of the trace you want to view and run the cell below.


```python
results.traces[0]["answer_correctness"]
```
Output
```

Here are some potential implications:\n\n1. Influence on other countries: The Supreme Court's ruling can serve as a reference point for other countries grappling with their own abortion laws. It can provide legal arguments and reasoning that advocates for reproductive rights can use to challenge restrictive abortion laws in their respective jurisdictions.\n\n2.

As you can see, it has the name of the prompt as the key and the input and output as the values. Since, I used AspectCriteriaMetric, the input and output is in the pydantic object used to parse input and output for the metric. You may convert it to a dictionary if needed. For example,


```python
selected_trace = results.traces[0]["answer_correctness"]
selected_trace["0_single_turn_aspect_critic_prompt_with_reference"][
    "input"
].model_dump()
```
Output

And that's it. Now you have learned how to export and analyze LLM calls made by ragas for evaluation.
