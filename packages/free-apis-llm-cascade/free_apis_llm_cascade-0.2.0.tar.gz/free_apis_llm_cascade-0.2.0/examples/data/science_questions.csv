According to the model, this theory can match the observed accelerating universe and cosmological constant, but it contradicts the Copernican principle."
What is radiosity in radiometry?,"Radiosity is the radiant flux leaving a surface per unit area, including emitted, reflected, and transmitted radiation."
What is reciprocal length or inverse length?,"Reciprocal length or inverse length is a quantity or measurement used in several branches of science and mathematics. It is the reciprocal of length, and common units used for this measurement include the reciprocal metre or inverse metre (symbol: m−1), the reciprocal centimetre or inverse centimetre (symbol: cm−1)."
What is resistivity?,Resistivity is an intrinsic property of a material that describes how difficult it is to make electrical current flow through it. It is measured in ohm-meters and is independent of the material's shape and size.
What is spontaneous symmetry breaking?,"Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the action of a theory has a symmetry, but the vacuum state violates this symmetry. In that case, there will exist a local operator that is non-invariant under the symmetry, giving it a nonzero vacuum expectation value."
