turtleBeads.py

Turtle graphics library for drawing various shapes centered on the
cursor.

In general, these functions draw things centered at the cursor, and put
the cursor back where it started afterwards. Set the pensize and pencolor
before drawing a shape to control what is drawn. For most shapes you can
also use fillcolor and begin_fill/end_fill to fill in the shape.
