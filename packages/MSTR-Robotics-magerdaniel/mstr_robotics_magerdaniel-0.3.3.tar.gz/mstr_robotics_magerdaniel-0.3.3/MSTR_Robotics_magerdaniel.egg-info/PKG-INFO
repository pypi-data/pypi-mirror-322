Hi,

welcome to MicroStrateg(P)ython. Now we can code on top of MSTR. Here you're right, if you wan't to code on top of MSTR. 
In February I provided a few files to demonstrate what can be done. I revamped my mstr_robotic package completely, in a style the I still expect a lot of changes, but the core structure is stabilizing. However we’re still in beta and I’m looking for people to discuss coding on top of MSTR.

So if you’re using my code, pls get in contact with me over linkedIn:

or

per mail danielmager@gmx.de


Cheers
Daniel
