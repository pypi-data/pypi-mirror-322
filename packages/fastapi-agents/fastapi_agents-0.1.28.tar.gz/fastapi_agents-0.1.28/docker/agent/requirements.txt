# Add your custom packages to install them at runtime if you
# volume mount requirements.txt at /app/agent/requirements.txt

# For production it is recommended to build them into the

# FROM blairhudson/fastapi-agents:pydantic-ai
# COPY requirements.txt .
# RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
