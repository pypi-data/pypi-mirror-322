    A SUBSCRIBER is a component that listens for messages published processes them accordingly.

    Unlike a CONSUMER, a SUBSCRIBER is responsible for processing messages based on the
    topic they were published to. It means that the PUBLISHER is responsible for deciding
    which handlers to invoke based on the topic of the message.

    Methods:
        register:
            Registers a message type and its corresponding handler function.

        handler:
            Decorator for registering a handler function to one or more topics.

        receive:
            Receives a message from a given topic and triggers the corresponding handler functions
            to process it.

        .. code-block:: python

        from pymsgbus import Subscriber
        from pymsgbus import Publisher
