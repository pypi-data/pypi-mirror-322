# cucaracha ðŸª³

Inspired by Franz Kafka's infamous character, Gregor Samsa â€” an ordinary man who wakes up to find himself transformed into a cockroach in *The Metamorphosis*. Here, `cucaracha` embodies the metaphor of a tireless, sometimes bureaucratic helper working tirelessly in the background. In the digital age, Mr. Cucaracha is here to assist you with the complex and often tedious tasks of document processing and analysis.

## Meet Mr. Cucaracha: Your Assistant for Digital Document Processing and Analysis

`cucaracha` is an open-source library crafted to help with digital document analysis and processing. It provides a toolkit for working with both structured and unstructured data, allowing users to collect, transform, and interpret textual content from various document formats, including PDFs and images. 

### Key Features

- **Text Extraction**: Efficiently retrieve text from PDFs and image files, transforming them into usable data.
- **Content Structuring**: Process extracted text into structured formats, aiding in more organized data handling and downstream applications.
- **Context Recognition**: Perform contextual analysis to interpret and label document content based on intended usage.

The major objective of this project is to offer an accessible, open-source alternative for processing document files, which provides document processing and analysis algorithms to simplify tasks that would traditionally be time-consuming or challenging to automate.

### Why `cucaracha`?

The name `cucaracha` reflects the tireless, behind-the-scenes nature of the tool. Like Kafka's transformed character, Mr. Cucaracha deals with the mundanity and bureaucracy often present in document processing tasks. He's designed to tackle these repetitive and complex tasks with minimal oversight, ensuring efficient and structured data extraction without the typical hurdles of document handling.
