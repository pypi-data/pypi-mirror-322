- Fix issues with hooking multiple functions which are overloads of the same base function.
- Add the ability for patterns to be hooked up using the `FUNC_PATTERNS` data in implementing libraries ([gh-14](https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/14))

### 0.1.5 (26/08/2024)

- Allow overriding of function return values.

- Overhauled config system to provide a more user-friendly experience.
- Fixed a critical bug in hooking which meant that no result was returned.

### 0.1.3 (31/07/2024)

- Implemented manual hooks. These are a decorator which have the can take an offset, name, and function definition, and allow for hooking a function without having to rely on the underlying library which utilises pymhf.

- Implemented custom triggers. They can be implemented by libraries which use this framework to enable custom triggers which are specific to the game/application.
- Fixed some issues with reloading of mods when there are multiple mods all contributing to compound hooks, including hooks with completely disabled detours.
- Added `@no_gui` decorator which can be applied to a `Mod` class to indicate that it doesn't need to be shown in the GUI.
