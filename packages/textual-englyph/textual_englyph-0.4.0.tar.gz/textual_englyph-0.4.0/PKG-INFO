or, use as a module in your textual python app. Save the following simple example as `test.py`
```python
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual_englyph import EnGlyph

class Test(App):
    DEFAULT_CSS = """
    EnGlyph {
        color: green;
        text-style: underline;
        }
    """

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield EnGlyph("Hello Textual!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = Test()
    app.run()
```
and run it (use ctrl-c to exit)
