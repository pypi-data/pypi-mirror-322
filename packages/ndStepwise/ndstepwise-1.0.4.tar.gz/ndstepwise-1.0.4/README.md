# multiclass-regression

Maxwell Dix-Matthews honours project in multicategory regression

TODO Project:
  1. Add hyperparameter tuning with the digits dataset - this would be a proper case study
  2. Run Kfolds for all datasets (5 results for ND and 5 result for other, try with multiple models too - this may make it more stable as it's got more options?)
  3. Look for more datasets to run it with

TODO Code: 
  1. Look into R's official implementation of ND traversal
  2. Move the cutoff function from model_functions.py to model.py
  3. Make it possible to call a model in the _exact_ same way as scikit
  4. Performance testing with and without threading
  5. Add unit tests
  6. Upgrade to python 3.14 to avoid GIL
  7. Add proper documentation around functions
