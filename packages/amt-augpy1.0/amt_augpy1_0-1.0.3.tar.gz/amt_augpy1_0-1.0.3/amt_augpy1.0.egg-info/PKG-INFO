A comprehensive Python toolkit for augmenting Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) datasets through various audio transformations while maintaining synchronization between audio and MIDI files.

## Features

- **Time Stretching**: Modify the tempo of audio files while maintaining pitch
- **Pitch Shifting**: Transpose audio files up or down while preserving timing
- **Reverb & Filtering**: Apply room acoustics and frequency filtering effects
- **Gain & Chorus**: Add depth and richness through gain and chorus effects
- **Smart Pause Detection**: Identify and manipulate musical pauses based on note timing
- **Audio Standardization**: Convert various audio formats to 44.1kHz WAV

## Installation

You can install amt-augpy either via pip or by cloning the repository:

### Using pip

    pip install amt-augpy1.0

### From source

    git clone https://github.com/LarsMonstad/amt-augpy1.0.git
    cd amt-augpy1.0
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Dependencies
- librosa
- soundfile
- numpy
- pedalboard
- pretty_midi
- tqdm

## Usage

### Basic Usage

    python -m amt_augpy.main /path/to/dataset/directory

This will process all compatible audio files in the directory and their corresponding MIDI files. The script automatically selects random parameters within predefined ranges (specified in main.py) for each augmentation type.

## Basic usage with pip 

	amt-augpy /path/to/dataset/directory

### Parameter Ranges (defined in main.py)

- Time stretch: 0.6 to 1.6x
- Pitch shift: -5 to +5 semitones
- Reverb room size: 10 to 100
- Gain: 2 to 11 dB
- Chorus depth: 0.1 to 0.6
- Filter cutoff pairs: Various predefined frequency ranges

Each input file will generate multiple augmented versions using randomly selected parameters within these ranges.

## File Format Support

### Audio
- Input: WAV, FLAC, MP3, M4A, AIFF 
- Output: WAV (44.1kHz)

### Annotations
- MIDI (.mid)

## Output Structure

For each input file pair (audio + MIDI), the toolkit generates multiple augmented versions with the following naming convention:

    original_name_effect_parameter_randomsuffix.extension

Example:

    piano_timestretch_1.2_abc123.wav
    piano_timestretch_1.2_abc123.mid

## Dataset Creation & Validation

The dataset follows the same format as [MAESTRO v3.0.0](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro), which is commonly used for Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) tasks. The main difference is that this dataset includes augmented versions of the original recordings.

### Creating the Dataset CSV

The script will create a CSV file containing all original and augmented files, organizing them into train/test/validation splits. Songs assigned to test or validation splits will have their augmented versions excluded to prevent data leakage.

```bash
# Create dataset with default split ratios (70% train, 15% test, 15% validation)
python create_maestro_csv.py /path/to/directory

# Create dataset with custom split ratios
python create_maestro_csv.py /path/to/directory --train-ratio 0.8 --test-ratio 0.1 --validation-ratio 0.1
```

### Validating the Dataset Split

To ensure data integrity, you can validate that no augmented versions of test/validation songs appear in the training set:

```bash
python validate_split.py /path/to/dataset.csv
```

The validation script checks for:
- Augmented songs incorrectly included in test/validation splits
- Cross-split contamination (augmented versions of test/validation songs appearing in training)
- Distribution of original vs augmented songs in each split

### CSV Format

The generated CSV follows the MAESTRO format with the following columns:
- canonical_composer
- canonical_title 
- split
- year
- midi_filename
- audio_filename
- duration
