`multiversum` is a package designed to make it easy to conduct multiverse analyses in Python. The package is intended to seemlessly integrate into a normal analysis or ML workflow and can also be added to an existing pipeline.

### Features

- **Simple** üß©: Built with the goal of being as simple as possible to integrate into existing workflows.
- **Parallel** üëØ: Different universes are automatically evaluated in parallel.
- **Notebooks** üìì: Analyses can be written as Jupyter notebooks.
- **Play/Pause** ‚èØÔ∏è: Interrupt and then continue a multiverse analysis where you left it.

## Installation

Install this library using `pip`:
```bash
pip install multiversum
```

## Usage

The package always works with two different files: The `multiverse.toml` ‚ú®Ô∏è, specifying the different dimensions (and their options) and the `universe.ipynb` ‚≠êÔ∏è containing the actual analysis code. The universe file is then evaluated (in parallel) using different dimension-combinations, by running `python -m multiversum`.

An example using a machine learning workflow in scikit-learn can be found [here](./examples/scikit-learn--simple/).

## Getting Started

To quickly get started with running your own multiverse analysis, you can use the [multiversum starter template](https://github.com/jansim/multiversum-template).

## Development

To contribute to this library, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

```bash
cd multiversum
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
```

To run the tests:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

### Formatting

Ruff is used for formatting and linting. Formatting can be automatically checked / applied wherever possible via `ruff check . --fix && ruff format`.

### Docs

The documentation is generated using mkdocs and can be locally run using `mkdocs serve` after installing its dependencies using `python -m pip install -e '.[docs]`.
