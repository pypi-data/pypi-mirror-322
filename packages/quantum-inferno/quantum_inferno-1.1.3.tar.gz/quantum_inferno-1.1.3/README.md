## Quantized Information Entropy, Nth Octave

### Caveat Emptor: Early Release Version

### Description
Computes standardized time-frequency representations (TFRs) for power, information, and entropy, 
built on the Gabor wavelets with minimal time-frequency uncertainty with 
logarithmic constant-Q base 2 (binary) scales and frequency bands of quantized order N.

All algorithms are based on FFTs for computational efficiency. 
The short-term Fourier transform (STFT) is included as the baseline TFR.
Algorithms for the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), 
and Stockwell Transform (STX) are provided.
