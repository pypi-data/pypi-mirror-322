## ENV

* CACHE_FOLDER: The folder to cache the data. Default:uval_root

## DATA

* PATH: Where to find the dataset. Default:uval_root/data/hdf5.
* IGNORE_MISSING_FILES: When True, files from the YAML that do not exist in data folder are ignored. Default:False
* MAX_THREADS: The number of loaders to load .h5 files. Default:8.
* CLASS_MAPPINGS: A list of dictionaries where the key is the desired class name and the values are the class names that will be mapped to the key. Used for mismatches between annotations or predictions or for category merging. Default:None

## DATA_SPLIT

* YAML: The YAML file containing the split information. Default:uval_root/data/datasplit/uval_ds.yaml
* SUBSET: Which subset of the data to run the test on. Default: ["train", "test"]
  
## METRICS

* CLASS_SPECIFIC_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD: A list of confidence thresholds for all or a subset of classes. When a class is not specified, the CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD will be used (see below). Default: None
* FACTOR: Factor for F-score. Default:1
* IOU_THRESHOLD: IOU threshold For single IOU evaluations. Otherwise ignored. Default:0.3
* IOU_RANGE: The range of IOUs for evaluation. Ignored when set to anything other than a tuple. Default:(0,)
* MAX_PROCESSES: Number of processes used to calculate range IOU recalls. Default:4.
* CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD: Confidence threshold For single Confidence evaluations. Otherwise ignored. Default:0.6
* AP_METHOD = choose between VOC2007 and VOC2012 type evaluation. Default: "EveryPointInterpolation" (VOC2012)

## OUTPUT

* PATH: Where to store the output. Default: a new folder named after the current time.
* TEMPLATES_PATH = Where to load report html templates. Default: /uval_root/src/uval/templates
* CONFIG_FILE = Default: "config.yaml"
* REPORT_FILE = Output report file name. Default:report.html
* METRICS_FILE = File to save the serialized version of the calculated metrics. Default:metrics.pickle
* DATASET_OVERVIEW_FILE = Detailed information about the dataset. Default:dataset_overview.csv
