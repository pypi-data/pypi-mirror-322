UVal - Unified eValuation framework for 3D X-ray data
---
> This python package is meant to provide a high level interface to facilitate the evaluation of object detection and segmentation algorithms that operate on 3D volumetric data.
---
- There is a growing need for high performance detection algorithms using 3D data, and it is very important to be able to compare them. By far, there has not been a trivial solution for a straightforward comparison between different 3D detection algorithms.
- This framework seeks a way to address the aforementioned problem by introducing a simple and standard layout of the popular HDF5 data format as input. 
- Each detection algorithm can export the results and groundtruth data according to the defined layout principles. Then, UVal can evaluate the performance and come up with common comparison metrics.

## Installation (non-development)
If you are not developing and only using UVal, you can simply install it as a `pypi` package (requires **Python 3.8** or higher); simply run:
```shell
pip install uval
```

If you would like to have UVal installation to be independant of a specific python environment, simply use `pipx` instead of `pip`.

To run the code you can type:
```shell
uval --config-file ${workspaceFolder}/output/example/config.yaml
```
For an example of the outputs see [here](https://gitlab.com/smithsdetection/uval/-/tree/main/output/example) and the report [here](https://gitlab.com/smithsdetection/uval/-/raw/main/output/example/report.pdf).

For the details of each entry in the config file please see [here](https://gitlab.com/smithsdetection/uval/-/raw/main/src/uval/config/README.md).

## Development setup

* First, please clone the UVal's git repository by executing the following command:  
  ```git clone https://gitlab.com/smithsdetection/uval.git```
  

* You will need a `python >= 3.8` environment to develop Uval.  
  We recommend using Anaconda due to its ease of use:
  ```shell
  curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
  bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
  ```
  For x86_64(amd64) use "Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64". For other operating systems see [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

* Close and reopen your terminal session.

* Setting up a `conda virtual environment` with `poetry` using the following commands:
  
  ```shell
  mamba env create -f environment.yml
  mamba activate UVALENV
  poetry install
  pre-commit install
  ```
  Alternatively, you can create your own conda environment from scratch. and follow with `poetry` and `pre-commit` installations.

## Example code
* A step-by-step walkthrough for reading and evaluating data with the UVal is available as a jupyter document:
  * [jupyter notebook demo](https://gitlab.com/smithsdetection/uval/-/blob/main/demo/sample-data-evaluation.ipynb)
------
  * **Hint:** Prior to running the demo jupyter notebook walkthrough, the following steps must be performed:
    
    * The `ipykernel` conda package must be installed
      ```shell
      conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
      ```
    * The `uvalenv` environment must be added as an ipykernel: 
      ```shell  
      python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name uvalenv --display-name "uvalenv Python38"
      ```
    * The `uvalenv Python38` kernel, which includes all the required python packages must be selected in `jupyter` environment to run the code.
