Create beautiful and interactive UpSet plots using Altair. UpSet plots are a powerful alternative to Venn diagrams for visualizing set intersections, especially when dealing with many sets.

![Example UpSet Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edmundmiller/altair-upset/main/docs/_static/example.png)

## Features

- üé® Beautiful, interactive visualizations powered by Altair/Vega-Lite
- üîÑ Dynamic sorting by frequency or degree
- üéØ Interactive highlighting and filtering
- üì± Responsive design that works in Jupyter notebooks and web browsers
- üé® Customizable colors, sizes, and themes
- üîç Tooltips with detailed intersection information
- üöÄ Support for both Pandas and Polars DataFrames

## Installation

```bash
pip install altair-upset
```

Or with conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge altair-upset
```

## Quick Start

```python
import altair_upset as au
import pandas as pd
# Or use Polars
import polars as pl

# Create sample data with Pandas
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'set1': [1, 0, 1, 1],
    'set2': [1, 1, 0, 1],
    'set3': [0, 1, 1, 0]
})

# Create UpSet plot
chart = au.UpSetAltair(
    data=data,  # or data_pl.to_pandas()
    sets=["set1", "set2", "set3"],
    title="Sample UpSet Plot"
)

# Display the chart
chart.show()
```

## Example Gallery

The package includes a comprehensive gallery of examples demonstrating various features and use cases:

### Basic Examples

- **Basic UpSet Plot**: Simple visualization of streaming service subscriptions
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Different ways to organize and present set intersections
- **Custom Styling**: Examples of color schemes, themes, and layout customization

### Real-World Examples

- **Gene Set Analysis**: Visualizing intersections of biological pathways
- **Survey Response Analysis**: Understanding multiple-choice survey patterns
- **Social Media Usage**: Exploring platform usage overlaps with demographics
- **Movie Genre Analysis**: Investigating genre combinations in film datasets

### Advanced Features

- **Interactive Selection**: Enhanced interaction and filtering capabilities
- **Custom Tooltips**: Rich tooltips with additional information
- **Responsive Design**: Adapting to different display sizes
- **Theme Examples**: Using built-in and custom themes

To run the examples:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edmundmiller/altair-upset.git
cd altair-upset
pip install -e ".[examples]"
python examples/basic_upset.py
```

Each example includes:

- Sample data generation or loading
- Plot creation with different features
- Analysis and statistics
- Detailed comments explaining each step

## Advanced Usage

### Sorting and Filtering

```python
# Sort by degree (number of sets in intersection)
chart = au.UpSetAltair(
    data=data,
    sets=["set1", "set2", "set3"],
    sort_by="degree",
    sort_order="descending"
)
```

### Customizing Appearance

```python
# Custom colors and sizes
chart = au.UpSetAltair(
    data=data,
    sets=["set1", "set2", "set3"],
    color_range=["#1f77b4", "#ff7f0e", "#2ca02c"],
    highlight_color="#d62728",
    width=800,
    height=500
)
```

### Using Abbreviations

```python
# Use abbreviations for long set names
chart = au.UpSetAltair(
    data=data,
    sets=["Very Long Set Name 1", "Very Long Set Name 2", "Very Long Set Name 3"],
    abbre=["S1", "S2", "S3"]
)
```

## Development

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edmundmiller/altair-upset.git

1. Turning it into a package
2. Snapshoting the functionality with Altair 4
3. Porting to Altair 5
4. Adding additional advanced features
