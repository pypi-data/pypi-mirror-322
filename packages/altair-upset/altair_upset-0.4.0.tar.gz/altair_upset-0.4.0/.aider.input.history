+There's a bug that was introduced in commit 5a34f7eb3b02ab7ca171b7248be93b7962fb0b38 that causes the dot graph on the bottom to not be aligned correctly. See https://github.com/edmundmiller/altair-upset/commit/5a34f7eb3b02ab7ca171b7248be93b7962fb0b38#diff-295da0054d49a9c18499de82c5d24859f9221c37ebe58ce67399c36328f3f732

+/code The dots are still a little tight vertically. Can you ensure they have some space?

# 2025-01-20 11:08:49.631842
+/code Hmm that didn't change anything. Maybe we could make the dots with the category abbreviations smaller? Could we also make the space between the dot matrix, category dots, and horizontal bar chart smaller? https://upset.app Here's an example for you to look at

+There's still alot of deadspace on the bottom of the plot. Can you fix that?

# 2025-01-20 11:18:22.126283
+Ah I think I see it. We need to make the `horizontal_bar_chart_width` proportional to the rest of the width

+That's awesome! There's still alot of dead space between the figures horizonally. Can you help with that? /web https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/generated/toplevel/altair.HConcatChart.html#altair.HConcatChart
