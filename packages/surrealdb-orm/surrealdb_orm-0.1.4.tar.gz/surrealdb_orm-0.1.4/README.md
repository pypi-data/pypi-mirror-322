🚀 **SurrealDB-ORM** is a lightweight ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) inspired by Django ORM, designed to simplify interactions with **SurrealDB** in Python projects. It provides an intuitive way to manage models, perform queries, and execute CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## ✅ Version

Alpha 0.1.4

---

## 📝 Description

SurrealDB-ORM offers a clean abstraction for handling SurrealDB through Python models.  
The goal is to simplify writing complex queries while providing an intuitive interface similar to modern ORMs like Django or SQLAlchemy.

---

## 📝 Requirements and tested based

- Python : 3.11~3.13
- Pydantic : 2.10.4
- SurrealDB Database Version : 2.1.4
- You need to set a SurrealDB to connect to.  

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install surrealdb-orm
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to define a model and interact with SurrealDB:

### 1. Define a Model

```python
from surreal_orm.modelBase import BaseSurrealModel
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional


class User(BaseSurrealModel):
    id: Optional[str] = None
    name: str = Field(..., max_length=100)
    email: str
```

### 2. Create and Save a User

```python
user = User(name="Alice", email="alice@example.com")
await user.save()
```

### 3. Query Users

```python
users = await User.objects().filter(name="Alice").exec()
for user in users:
    print(user.name, user.email)
```
