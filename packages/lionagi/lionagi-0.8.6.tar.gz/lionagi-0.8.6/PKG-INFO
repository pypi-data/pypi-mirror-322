           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# LION Framework
### Language InterOperable Network - The Future of Controlled AI Operations

> Harness the power of next-generation AI while maintaining complete control and reliability.

## Why LION?

The AI revolution is transforming how we work - but with great power comes great responsibility. LION provides the control mechanisms and reliability features needed to safely integrate advanced AI capabilities into enterprise workflows.

LION is designed to be:
- 🔒 **Controlled**: Built-in safety mechanisms and verification
- 🎯 **Precise**: Exact control over AI behaviors
- 🔧 **Flexible**: Build any workflow you need
- 🚀 **Efficient**: Minimal dependencies, maximum performance



## Installation

LION maintains minimal dependencies for maximum reliability:

```bash
uv pip install lionagi
```

Dependencies:
- litellm
- jinja2
- pandas
- pillow
- python-dotenv


## Quick Start

```python
from lionagi import iModel, Branch

# Initialize model
gpt4o = iModel(provider="openai", task="chat", model="gpt-4o")

hunter = Branch(
  system="you are a hilarious dragon hunter who responds in 10 words rhymes",
  imodel=gpt4o,
)

# Chat asynchronously
print(await hunter.communicate("I am a dragon"))
```

```
You claim to be a dragon, oh what a braggin'!
```

## 📦 Features

### 1. Model Agnostic Structured Output

LION provides a unified interface for interacting with any AI model, regardless of the underlying architecture. This allows you to easily switch between models without changing your code.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Joke(BaseModel):
  joke: str

sonnet = iModel(
  provider="anthropic",
  model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  max_tokens=100,                    # max_tokens is required for anthropic models
)

response = await hunter.communicate(
  instruction="I am a dragon",
  response_format=Joke,           # structured output in given pydantic model
  clear_messages=True,            # refresh the conversation
  imodel=sonnet,                  # use sonnet model, which doesn't support structured output
)

print(type(response))
print(response.joke)
```

```
<class '__main__.Joke'>
Joke(joke='With fiery claws, dragons hide their laughter flaws!')
```


### 2. Complete Observability

```python
# using perplexity model
pplx_small = iModel(
    provider="perplexity",
    task="chat/completions",
    model="llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
    max_tokens=1000,
)

b = await hunter.communicate(
    instruction="What makes a well-behaved dragon?",
    clear_messages=True,            # refresh the conversation
    imodel=pplx_small,              # use perplexity model
)

print(b)
```

```
A well-behaved dragon is one that's calm and bright,
No stress or fear, just a peaceful night.
It's active, not lethargic, with a happy face,
And behaviors like digging, not a frantic pace.
It's social, friendly, and never a fright,
Just a gentle soul, shining with delight
```

```python
hunter.msgs.last_response.model_response
```

```

### 3. Easy composition of complex workflows

```python
# chain of thoughts
from pydantic import Field

class Reason(BaseModel):
  reason: str
  confidence_score: float

class Thought(BaseModel):
  thought: str

class Analysis(BaseModel):
  thought: list[Thought] = Field(
    default_factory=list, 
    description="concise Chain of thoughts from you, 3 step, each in 8 words"
  )
  analysis: str = Field(
    ...,
    description="Final analysis of the dragon's psyche in 20 words",
  )
  reason: list[Reason] = Field(
    default_factory=list,
    description="Concise Reasoning behind the analysis, 3 support, each in 8 words"
  )

context1 = "I am a dragon, I think therefore I am, I suffer from shiny objects syndrome"
context2 = "I like food and poetry, I use uv sometimes, it's cool but I am not familiar with pip"

async def analyze(context) -> Analysis:
  psychologist = Branch(
    system="you are a renowned dragon psychologist",
    imodel=gpt4o,
  )
  return await psychologist.communicate(
    instruction="analyze the dragon's psyche using chain of thoughts",
    guidance="think step by step, reason with logic",
    context=context,
    response_format=Analysis,
  )

```

```python
result1 = await analyze(context1)

print("\nThoughts:")
for i in result1.thought:
    print(i.thought)

print("\nAnalysis:")    
print(result1.analysis)

print("\nReasoning:")
for i in result1.reason:
    print(i.reason)
```

```

Thoughts:
Dragons are attracted to shiny objects naturally.
This suggests a strong affinity for hoarding.
Reflects the dragon's inherent desire for possession.

Analysis:
The dragon demonstrates a compulsive hoarding behavior linked to attraction for shiny objects.

Reasoning:
Shiny objects trigger instinctual hoarding behavior.
Possession indicates a symbol of power and security.
Hoarding is reinforced by evolutionary survival mechanisms.
```

```python
result2 = await analyze(context2)

print("\nThoughts:")
for i in result2.thought:
    print(i.thought)

print("\nAnalysis:")    
print(result2.analysis)

print("\nReasoning:")
for i in result2.reason:
    print(i.reason)
```

```
Thoughts:
Dragon enjoys both food and poetry regularly.
Dragon uses uv light with frequent interest.
Dragon is unfamiliar and not comfortable with pip.

Analysis:
The dragon is curious and exploratory, yet selectively cautious about unfamiliar methodologies.

Reasoning:
Preference for food and poetry suggests curiosity.
Frequent uv light use indicates exploratory nature.
Discomfort with pip usage shows selective caution.
```
