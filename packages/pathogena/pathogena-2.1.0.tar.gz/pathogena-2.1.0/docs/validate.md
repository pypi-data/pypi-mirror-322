## `pathogena validate`

```text
$ pathogena validate -h
16:00:13 INFO: EIT Pathogena client version 2.0.0rc1
Usage: pathogena validate [OPTIONS] UPLOAD_CSV

  Validate a given upload CSV.

Options:
  --host TEXT  API hostname (for development)
  -h, --help   Show this message and exit.
```

The `validate` command will check that a Batch can be created from a given CSV and if your user account has permission
to upload the samples, the individual FastQ files are then checked for validity. These checks are already performed
by default with the `upload` command but using this can ensure validity without commiting to the subsequent upload
if you're looking to check a CSV during writing it.
