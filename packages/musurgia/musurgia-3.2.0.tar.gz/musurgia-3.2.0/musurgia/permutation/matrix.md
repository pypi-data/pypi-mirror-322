These data structures can be referred to as:

- **0-dimensional:** Scalar
- **1-dimensional:** Vector
- **2-dimensional:** Matrix
- **3-dimensional:** Tensor (specifically a rank-3 tensor)
- **4-dimensional:** Tensor (specifically a rank-4 tensor)

The term "tensor" is a generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions. Scalars are rank-0
tensors, vectors are rank-1 tensors, matrices are rank-2 tensors, and so forth. The term "rank" refers to the number of
dimensions of the tensor. So, for example, a rank-3 tensor is a three-dimensional array, and a rank-4 tensor is a
four-dimensional array.

Sure, here are examples for each dimension:

0-dimensional (Scalar):

```
5
```

This is simply a single scalar value.

1-dimensional (Vector):

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This is a one-dimensional array containing five elements.

2-dimensional (Matrix):

```
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```

This is a two-dimensional array, commonly known as a matrix, with three rows and three columns.

3-dimensional:

```
[
  [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
  ],
  [
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8]
  ]
]
```

This is a three-dimensional array where each element is a 2x2 matrix.

4-dimensional:

```
[
  [
    [
      [1, 2],
      [3, 4]
    ],
    [
      [5, 6],
      [7, 8]
    ]
  ],
  [
    [
      [9, 10],
      [11, 12]
    ],
    [
      [13, 14],
      [15, 16]
    ]
  ]
]
```

This is a four-dimensional array where each element is a 2x2x2 matrix.
