description = "OmegaAgents is a scalable ReAct-based multi-agent framework designed for rapid solution development. It enables LLMs and agents to dynamically create and coordinate sub-agents during inference, mimicking human-like task distribution and collaboration. With built-in tools, parallel processing, and ephemeral memory management, it streamlines complex problem-solving through autonomous agent orchestration and structured output validation."
