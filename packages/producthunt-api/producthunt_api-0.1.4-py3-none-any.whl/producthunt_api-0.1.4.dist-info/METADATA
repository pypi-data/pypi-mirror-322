# ProductHunt API

**ProductHunt API** is a Python-based library developed by **Unrealos** ([unrealos.com](https://unrealos.com)) to automate the process of fetching, processing, and converting Product Hunt data into CSV format. It’s designed for developers and businesses to streamline data collection from Product Hunt categories.

---

## Key Features
- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Fetch products from any Product Hunt category using GraphQL.
- **Data Parsing**: Process product details and save them as structured JSON files.
- **CSV Export**: Convert parsed data into CSV format for reporting or analysis.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy-to-use pipeline designed for automation.

---

## Installation

### Install from PyPI
You can install the library directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install producthunt-api
```

### Verify Installation
To confirm the installation was successful, run:
```bash
python -m producthunt_api --help
```

---

## Setting Up

Before running the pipeline, you need to extract some data from Product Hunt.

### 1. Parsing Category Data
To fetch data from a specific category, follow these steps:

1. Open the Product Hunt category page you want to scrape (e.g., [AI Software](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-software)).
2. Open your browser's developer tools (usually accessible via `F12` or right-click > `Inspect`).
3. Go to the **Network** tab.
4. Locate the request to `https://www.producthunt.com/frontend/graphql`. This request contains:
   - **OperationName**: `"CategoryPageQuery"`
5. Extract the following from the request:
   - **Cookie**: Copy the `Cookie` string from the request headers.
   - **SHA256 Hash**: Copy the `sha256Hash` value from the request payload.

---

## Usage

### Pipeline Workflow
The pipeline automates the following steps:
1. **Data Fetching**: Fetch products from a specified Product Hunt category.
2. **Product Processing**: Parse and save product details as JSON files.
3. **CSV Export**: Convert the JSON files into a CSV file for further use.

### Running the Pipeline
Create a Python script and use the following example to run the pipeline:

```python
import os
from producthunt_api import ProductHuntPipeline

# Define necessary variables
directory = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "downloads")
cookie_value = "<YOUR_COOKIE>"
sha256_hash_value = "<YOUR_SHA256_HASH>"
slug_value = "ai-software"  # Replace with your desired category slug

# Initialize and run the pipeline
pipeline = ProductHuntPipeline(
    directory=directory,
    cookie=cookie_value,
    sha256_hash=sha256_hash_value,
    slug=slug_value
)
pipeline.run(limit=50, max_threads=10)
```

1. Replace `<YOUR_COOKIE>` and `<YOUR_SHA256_HASH>` with the values you extracted earlier.
2. Save the script and run it:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

---

## Testing the Library

To ensure everything is working as expected, you can run the test suite.

1. Install testing dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-cov
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest -v
   ```
