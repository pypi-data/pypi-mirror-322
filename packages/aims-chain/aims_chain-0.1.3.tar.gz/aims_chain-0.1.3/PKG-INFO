        We want to make it absolutely clear that we only choose to include the
        "aimsChain" code in this directory here for the convenience of
        FHI-aims users. We are not interested in violating anyone's license
        and we are not interested in keeping the code secret or hidden. 
        
        All the code in the "aimsChain" directory comes under the LGPL . It is
        python code and does not link directly to any of the FHI-aims source
        code elsewhere in this distribution. We thus believe that we are in
        compliance with the LGPL both in fact and in spirit.

aimsChain
=========
aimsChain developed for FHI-aims ( https://fhi-aims.org/ )

**A package for finding minimum energy path and transition state:** This project aims to provide an all-in-one package for various flavours of the chain of states methods for finding the minimum energy path(MEP). Currently the nudged elastic band method (NEB)[1, 2], the string method[3], and the growing string method[4] are included.

For usage please refer to FHI-aims manual.

The aimsChain code is distributed under the Lesser General Public License as published in Version 3, 29 June 2007, at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html . Some of the optimizer routines in the code originated within the Atomic Simulation Environment
(ASE) https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase [5]. We wish to give full credit to the developers of these routines and original authors - Yingyu Yao and people involved in ASE [5].

Python2 to Python3 transition and update of the test done by Ondrej Krejci, CEST group, Aalto University 2022 - ondrej.krejci(at)aalto.fi. I cannot develop and maintain the code in the future. If you are interested, please contact me and FHI-aims team (Ideally via a Slack channel) to take over it. 

Tests are in the samples directory together with their optimized results; except for sample5 examples, which never run!
sample7 and sample7.1 are almost the same; just there are 10 inner images in 7.1 (instead of 3) and the first image is slightly shifted.
