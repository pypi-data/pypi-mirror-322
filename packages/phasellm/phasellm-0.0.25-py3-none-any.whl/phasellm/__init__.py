Welcome to PhaseLLM!

We are a framework to help you build robust Large Language Model (LLM)-based apps. Please visit our site at phasellm.com for documents, tutorials, and more.

The module comes with the following submodules:
- agents: components that can execute specific tasks, such as downloading the latest news, executing code, sending an email, and more.
- eval: ways to evaluate LLM and app performance.
- exceptions: classes to track LLM-specific types of exceptions.
- llms: helper classes for dealing with LLMs, including wrappers for popular models, chatbots, and more.
