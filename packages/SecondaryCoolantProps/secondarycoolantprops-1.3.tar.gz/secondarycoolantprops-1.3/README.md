# Secondary Coolant Props

This repo contains some fluid property routines for secondary coolants. It is based on the correlations developed by Ã…ke Melinder, 2010 "Properties of Secondary Working Fluids for Indirect Systems" 2nd ed., International Institute of Refrigeration.

This is intended to be a lightweight library that can be easily imported into any other Python tool, with no bulky dependencies.
