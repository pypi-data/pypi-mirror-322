PyPI Examiner scrapes PyPI for a few things the JSON API doesn't provide. Currently, this supports:

* Finding the current maintainers' usernames for any package
* Finding all packages that a given user maintains

This package should not be considered especially stable at this time, and may cease to function or may be heavily revised without notice.

Please be responsible when scraping PyPI, as PyPI maintainers have been [forced to block bots and bot-like behavior](https://discuss.python.org/t/fastly-interfering-with-pypi-search/73597/8) starting Dec 4th-6th 2024, due to millions of uncached requests being made in a short timeframe which took PyPI down. All requests made by this package now include a 5-second wait - both to ensure politeness, and to ensure Fastly lets our browser through (Chromium, via [requests-html](https://github.com/psf/requests-html), which includes [pyppeteer](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer)).

### Usage

```
from pypi_examiner import examiner

pypi = examiner()
who = pypi.who_maintains("unishox2_py3")
# who is: ["tweedge"]

maint = pypi.maintained_by("tweedge")
# maint is: ["unishox2-py3", "pypi-examiner", "dns-mollusc"]
```

If the package does not exist, the maintainer owns no packages, or another error has arose: expect the result to be `[]`

### Support

This package is built/tested for Ubuntu, per CI.
