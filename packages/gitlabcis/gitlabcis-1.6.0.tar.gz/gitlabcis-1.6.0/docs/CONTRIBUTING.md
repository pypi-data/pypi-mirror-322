## Setup Dev Environment

Check out [the docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/govern/compliance/engineering/cis/gitlabcis/-/blob/main/docs/readme.md?ref_type=heads#for-developers-install) on how to install the dependencies.

```sh
# obtain a copy of the repo
git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/govern/compliance/engineering/cis/gitlabcis.git
cd gitlabcis

# install the dependencies
make

# OR without `make`:
python3 -m pip install -q .
python3 -m pip install -q .\[test,build\]

# start working out of a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/idea
```

### Pre-commit hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure that what's committed to the repository has already passed validation checks locally.

Review the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to see what checks run.

### Run CLI live tests against the source code

When you make a change to the codebase in _your_ branch, run `make install` again, to recieve a _fresh_ copy of `gitlabcis` to run live tests against.

```sh
# gitlabcis should now be added to the PATH:
gitlabcis https://gitlab.example.com/path/to/project

# for CLI arg help see:
gitlabcis --help
```

## Running unit tests

To run all of the pytest tests:

```sh
# inside the gitlabcis dir run:
pytest -s -vv tests/

# or without debug in stdout:
pytest tests
```
