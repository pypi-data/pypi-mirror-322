## LLM context files

Using LLMs for development is a best practice way to get started and
explore. While LLMs cannot code for you, they can be helpful assistants.
You must check, refactor, test, and vet any code any LLM generates for
you - but they are helpful productivity tools.

- [llms.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnswerDotAI/monsterui/refs/heads/main/nbs/llms.txt):
  Links to the neccesary reference documents to use the MonsterUI
  library effectively. Contains very little information directly in the
  document.
- [llms-ctx.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnswerDotAI/monsterui/refs/heads/main/nbs/llms-ctx.txt):
  MonsterUI specific context only (does not include FastHTML specific
  context)
- [llm-ctx-full.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnswerDotAI/monsterui/refs/heads/main/nbs/llms-ctx-full.txt):
  All inclusive FastHTML + MonsterUI context
