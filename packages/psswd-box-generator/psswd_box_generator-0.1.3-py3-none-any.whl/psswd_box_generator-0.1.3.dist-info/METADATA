## Purpose

This was a library I wrote for another project of mine called [Psswd Box](https://psswdbox.com/). It will generate passwords of various character types and lengths. By default, just running it as main will produce a password with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and it will be 20 characters long.
