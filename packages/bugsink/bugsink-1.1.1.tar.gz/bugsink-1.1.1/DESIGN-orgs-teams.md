Thoughts on Teams and Organizations

Our approach doesn't incorporate a sentry-like model for "teams." Instead, individuals are either part of a project or
not. Envisioned roles are:

* read-only access
* regular (allowing state changes to issues)
* admin (with privileges to manage settings and memberships).

Regarding organizations, the use cases are:

* if you're employed at "big-co", it serves as a platform to establish your "bigger team," which could oversee multiple
  see e.g. GitHub, GitLab, and CloudFoundry for comparison
* when I develop hosted.bugsink.com, the "organization" is the natural unit a user will have access to or not.

These organizations can serve as points for inherited permissions, as well as provide a systematic grouping of
projects. Additionally, they serve as a central repository for inheritable settings, streamlining the management and
configuration of multiple projects within a broader organizational context.
