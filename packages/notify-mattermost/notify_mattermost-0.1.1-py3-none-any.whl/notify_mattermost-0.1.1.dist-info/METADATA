## Installation

> First make sure to set up a Bot account on your Mattermost Server with the name `notify`. Follow the [Documentation](https://mattermost-notify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_bot.html) to learn how. 


If you have your `notify`Bot account set up correctly and you have got it's access token you can install the client package using:

```bash
# (yep it's in reverse since another project already used the name on PyPi ðŸ˜…)
pip install notify-mattermost
```

Then set up the connection using: 

```bash
# follow the dialog...
mattermost-notify setup
```

Now you can test your connection by sending a dummy message to your own user account by doing:

```bash
mattermost-notify send "my first message" --user your-username
```

If you set up everything correctly you should have received a message at this point!


## Quick Example from Python
The Python API is very straightforward to use. A quick example (after having set up everything at installation) would look like this:

```python
import mattermost_notify as notify

# initialze the connection
notify.wakeup()

# send a message to a channel
notify.notify("This is a test message", channel_name="some_channel")

# you can also upload files in this way
notify.notify("My latest log file", user="your_username", files=["my_pipeline/log.txt"])
```
