# bbmapy

A Python wrapper for BBTools.  
Current BBMap version: 0.0.41

## Installation
1. Lazy way - Clone this repository, download bbmap, and install the package:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/urineri/bbmapy.git
   cd bbmapy
   cd vendor
   rm bb* -rf
   wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/files/latest/download -O bbtools.tar.gz
   tar -xf bbtools.tar.gz
   cd ..
   pip install -e .
   generate-bbmapy-commands
   ```
   The above should be automatically done or just not needed if you are installing from pip (pypi)
   
2. Unlazy way - is commented out below this line, that's how much it isn't suggested.
<!-- Add the BBTools submodule:
   ```
   git submodule add https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/jgi-bbtools.git vendor/bbtools
   ```

3. Initialize and update the submodule:
   ```
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

4. Install the package:
   ```
   pip install .
   ```

5. Generate the commands:
   ```
   generate-bbmapy-commands
   ```
6. Now actually delete the git submodule in vendor and replace it with the sourceforge version (i.e. the lazy way):
```
cd vendor/
rm bb* -rf
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/files/latest/download -O bbtools.tar.gz
tar -xf bbtools.tar.gz

``` -->
<!-- 
Note: Steps 2 and 3 are only necessary if you're setting up the project for the first time or if the submodule hasn't been added yet. If you're cloning the repository and the submodule has already been added, you can use: -->
<!-- 
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourusername/bbmapy.git
```

This will clone the repository and initialize the submodule in one step... I think? -->



## Dependencies
- Java  
- BBmap  (the above steps should download it to the vendor subdirectory...).  
If you rather this to use your own bbmap etc, go to the base.py script and comment out line 51, then uncomment line 52.
- rich (for pretty printing)

## Usage

After installation, you can use bbmapy in your Python scripts like this:

```python
from bbmapy import bbduk

# Basic usage
bbduk(
    in_file="input.fastq",
    out="output.fastq",
    ktrim="r",
    k="23",
    mink="11",
    hdist="1",
    tbo=True,
    tpe=True,
    minlen="45",
    ref="adapters",
    ftm="5",
    maq="6",
    maxns="1",
    ordered=True,
    threads="4",
    overwrite="t",
    stats="stats.txt"
)
```
### Using Java flags alongside other arguments
```python
bbduk(
    Xmx="2g",  # Set maximum heap size
    da=True,   # Enable assertions
    eoom=True, # Enable out-of-memory termination
    in_file="input.fastq",
    out="output.fastq",
    ktrim="r",
    k="23"
)
```

### To capture output
You need to set `capture_output=True` in the function call, AND out="stdout.fastq" (or any other file format you like). 
```python
stdout, stderr = bbduk(
    capture_output=True,
    Xmx="2g",
    in_file="input.fastq",
    out="stdout.fastq",
    # ... other parameters ...
)
```

#### Notes:
 * `in` can be a protected word in python and other code, it is replaced by `in_file` in function calls. `in1`, `in2` are still valid.
 * Java flags (such as `Xmx`, `Xms`, `da`, `ea`, `eoom`) are automatically recognized and handled appropriately. Include them in your function calls just like any other argument.
 * the `capture_output` argument might be switched (stderr --> out and vice verse). 
 * Flags (i.e. argument that do not take value in the OG bbmap version) are set with Boolean values. e.g.:
 ``` 
 flag : True
 ```
 Not to be mistaken for lower case, fouble qouted `"true"` and `"false"` for boolian arguments to be passed to bbtools, e.g.:
 ```
 argument : "true"
 ```
