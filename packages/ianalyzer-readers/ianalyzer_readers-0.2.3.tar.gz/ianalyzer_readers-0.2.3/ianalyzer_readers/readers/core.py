'''
This module defines the base classes on which all Readers are built.

It implements very little functionality of its own, but defines the interface
that Readers implement.

The module defines two classes, `Field` and `Reader`.

'''Type definition of the data types a Reader method can handle.'''

Source = Union[SourceData, Tuple[SourceData, Dict]]
'''
Type definition for the source input to some Reader methods.

Sources are either:

- a string with the path to a filename
- binary data with the file contents. This is not supported on all Reader subclasses
- a requests.Response
- a tuple of one of the above, and a dictionary with metadata

'''

Document = Dict[str, Any]
'''
Type definition for documents, defined for convenience.

Each document extracted by a Reader is a dictionary, where the keys are names of
the Reader's `fields`, and the values are based on the extractor of each field.
'''

class Field(object):
    '''
    Fields are the elements of information that you wish to extract from each document.

    Parameters:
        name:  a short hand name (name), which will be used as its key in the document
        extractor: an Extractor object that defines how this field's data can be
            extracted from source documents.
        required: whether this field is required. The `Reader` class should skip the
            document is the value for this Field is `None`, though this is not supported
            for all readers.
        skip: if `True`, this field will not be included in the results.

class Reader(object):
    '''
    A base class for readers. Readers are objects that can generate documents
    from a source dataset.

    Subclasses of `Reader` can be created to read particular data formats or even
    particular datasets.
    
    The `Reader` class is not intended to be used directly. Some methods need to
    be implemented in child components, and will raise `NotImplementedError` if
    you try to use `Reader` directly.

    A fully implemented `Reader` subclass will define how to read a dataset by
    describing:

    - How to obtain its source files.
    - What fields each document contains.
    - How to extract said fields from the source files.
