# SnapManager

A tool for managing VSS-enabled snapshots in Google Cloud Platform. Currently supports restoring VSS snapshots and creating bootable VM instances from them.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Cloud SDK
- Google Cloud Service Account with the following permissions:
  - `roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1`
  - `roles/compute.networkAdmin`
  - `roles/compute.securityAdmin`

## Authentication

SnapManager uses Google Cloud Application Default Credentials for authentication. You can set this up in one of two ways:

1. **Service Account Key File (Recommended for production)**:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account-key.json"
   ```

2. **User Credentials (Good for development)**:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

## Installation

```bash
pip install snapmanager
```

## Usage

```bash
# Show help
snapmanager restore --help

# Restore a VSS snapshot
snapmanager restore \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --zone ZONE \
  --vpc-network NETWORK_NAME \
  --subnet SUBNET_NAME \
  --snapshot SNAPSHOT_NAME
```

### Command Arguments

- `--project`: Google Cloud project ID where the snapshot and new VM will be created
- `--zone`: Google Cloud zone where the new VM will be created
- `--vpc-network`: VPC network to attach the new VM to
- `--subnet`: Subnet within the VPC network for the new VM
- `--snapshot`: Name of the VSS-enabled snapshot to restore from
- `--verbose`: Show detailed progress information for each step

## Example

```bash
snapmanager restore \
  --project my-project \
  --zone europe-west1-b \
  --vpc-network default \
  --subnet default \
  --snapshot my-windows-vss-snapshot
```

This will:
1. Create a new disk from the VSS snapshot
2. Create a temporary VM to make the disk bootable
3. Run necessary Windows boot configuration commands
4. Create a final VM with the bootable disk
5. Clean up temporary resources
