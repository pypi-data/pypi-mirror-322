## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

Run the `libra` command to scan a directory and generate the HTML file:

```bash
libra
```

You will be prompted to enter the path to your eBook folder. After processing, the script will generate two files:

1. **`libra_ebook_data.json`**: Contains metadata for all eBooks.
2. **`libra_ebook_library.html`**: Displays the eBook library in a browser.

### Example

```bash
$ libra
Enter the path to your eBook folder: /path/to/your/ebook/folder
JSON data saved to libra_ebook_data.json
HTML file generated at libra_ebook_library.html. Open it in a browser to view your eBook library.
```

## HTML Output

The generated `libra_ebook_library.html` file will display the eBooks in a clean, searchable format. Each book entry includes:

- **Title**: The title of the book (or the file name if the title is unavailable).
- **Author**: The author of the book (or "Unknown" if unavailable).
- **Format**: The file format (e.g., PDF, EPUB).
- **Size**: The file size in KB.
- **Click to Google**: A link to search for the book on Google.

## Customization

### HTML Template

You can customize the HTML template in the `html_generator.py` file to change the layout, styling, or functionality.
