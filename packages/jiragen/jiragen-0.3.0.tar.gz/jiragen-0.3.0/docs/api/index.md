## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of using JiraGen's API to generate and upload a ticket:

```python
from jiragen.core.client import VectorStoreClient
from jiragen.cli.generate import generate_issue
from jiragen.cli.upload import upload_command

# Initialize vector store
store = VectorStoreClient()

# Generate ticket content
result = generate_issue(
    store=store, message="Add dark mode support", model="openai/gpt-4o", upload=True
)

if result:
    print("âœ¨ Ticket generated and uploaded successfully!")
```
