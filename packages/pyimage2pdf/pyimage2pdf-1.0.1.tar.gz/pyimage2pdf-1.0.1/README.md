# Introduction

```

# Overview

The basic command structure is:

```bash
    Usage: image2pdf [OPTIONS]
    
      This command converts input image files to pdf;  If
      you omit the output file name the command deduces the name
      based on the input file name
    
    Options:
      --version               Show the version and exit.
      -i, --input-file PATH   The input image file name to convert.  [required]
      -o, --output-file PATH  The output pdf file name.
      -t, --title TEXT        The title to put on pdf file
      --help                  Show this message and exit.
```


A simple example:

```bash
image2pdf -i tests/resources/images/CompactImageDump.png
```
produces the following output:

```bash

Using input file name as base for output file name
Output file name is: CompactImageDump.pdf

```
# Installation

```bash
pip install pyimage2pdf
```

## Developer Notes
This project uses [buildlackey](https://github.com/hasii2011/buildlackey) for day to day development builds.

Also notice that this project does not include a `requirements.txt` file.  All dependencies are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file.

#### Install the main project dependencies

```bash
pip install .
```

#### Install the test dependencies

```bash
pip install .[test]
```

#### Install the deploy dependencies

```

Normally, not needed because the project uses a GitHub workflow that automatically deploys releases

I am concerned about GitHub's Copilot project



I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org).

While I do not advocate for all the issues listed there I do not like that a company like Microsoft may profit from open source projects.

I continue to use GitHub because it offers the services I need for free.  But, I continue to monitor their terms of service.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.
