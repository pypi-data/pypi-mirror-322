# VFG v 0.4.0

Changes to [VFG 0.3.0 ](../0_3_0):

- Add optional `metadata` field, which optionally allows one to specify `model_type` (Bayesian network, Markov random field, POMDP, or generic factor graph (which is also the assumed default, but might be nice to be able to mark explicitly)), as well as a `model_version` which keeps track of the version of the factor graph/model being defined, and an arbitrary `description` field.
