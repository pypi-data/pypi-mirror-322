# Owl-Eye

Owl-Eye is a Python package that allows users to perform WHOIS lookups for domains or IP addresses. It parses and displays essential information such as registration details, name servers, ownership details, and more.

This package is based on the original script by [LaviruD](https://github.com/LaviruD/Owl-Eye) and has been modularized and packaged for ease of use and distribution.
