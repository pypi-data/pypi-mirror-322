## About PyXC

PyXC is a point-to-point correlation tool based on Python. This library aims for a self-documenting correlation library on top of the IPython environment.

Please refer the following link for the documentation: [Read the docs](https://pyxc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Install
```bash
pip install pyxc
``` 
## Requirement
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Numpy
- Scipy

## Functionality
- Point-to-point correlation. For example:
    - Correlation between EBSD and optical microscopy.
    - Correlation between EBSD and nano-indentation grid.
