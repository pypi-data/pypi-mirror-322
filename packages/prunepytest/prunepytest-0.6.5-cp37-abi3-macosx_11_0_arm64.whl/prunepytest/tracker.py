    Tracker is the heart of the validation logic

    We want to make sure that the module import graph derived by parsing the Python code
    is accurate. At least accurate enough that when we compute a set of affected test files
    based on a set of modified files, we do not accidentally miss relevant test files.

    To achieve that, Tracker hooks into the Python import machinery, before any code covered
    by the import graph is loaded. Then as module gets loaded, Tracker recognizes the one that
    are relevant, and builds a transitive closure of the *actual* Python import graph, including
    both static and dynamic imports.

    This actual import graph can then be compared against the Rust-derived one that only relies
    on static information (and whatever extra information is provided by project-specific hooks),
    to ensure that the Rust-derived one is a *superset* of the one obtain by the Python Tracker.

    The concept is fairly simple, and the implementation is reasonably straightforward, but there
    are some notable fiddly corner-cases to ensure robust tracking regardless of the order in
    which code is imported, of the presence of import cycles, and of the need to track, and
    possibly aggregate, dynamic imports.
