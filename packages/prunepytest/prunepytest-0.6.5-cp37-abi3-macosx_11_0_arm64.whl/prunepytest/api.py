        the global namespace. Instead, we only want to affect *leaves* of the import

        means test files or command line entry points). This in turns means we need to
        add those *after* computing the transitive closure, which means the order in
        which they are added matters, hence the use of a sequence of item, instead of
        a mapping.

        The first key of each item (i.e. the first element of the tuple), is a Python
        import path, or file path, as in dynamic_dependencies. The second key, in the
        mapping, is the filesystem path to a source root, as each source root now gets
        a distinct set of dynamic dependencies. The value, in the mapping, is a set of
        extra direct dependencies to be added to the import graph.
