    Given a pytest Item, return the path of the test file it comes from

    This is usually straightforwardly obtained from item.location[0], but
    sometimes that location does not point to a covered Python file.

    In that case, we perform a best-effort handling of data-driven tests,
    by walking up the Item tree, and looking for a parent whose path is
    a real Python file. If no such file can be found, the test item will
    be treated safely:

     - it is never be deselected based on import graph/modified files
     - import validation is skipped, since we cannot infer a reasonable
       set of imports for that test item, and we want to avoid spurious
       validation errors
