![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec84044c-287a-4e39-bdf7-aa27cdc486f9)

To test models, download [these models](https://github.com/MetaCell/PsyNeuLinkView/tree/feature/PSYNEU-140/test_models) and import one at a time to test. Each time a Model is open, the previous one will disappear. I recommend you start with the models inside 'working_tests', as those are the ones we know for sure should we working.

To import go to File -> Open Models
