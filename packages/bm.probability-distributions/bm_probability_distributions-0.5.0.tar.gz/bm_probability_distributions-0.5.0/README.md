# Boring Math Libraries - Probability distributions

Package to generate and visualize probability distributions.

Part of the "Boring Math" PyPI **bm** namespace for mathematical hobby
projects. A work-in-progress.

* **Repositories**
  * [bm.probability-distributions][1] project on *PyPI*
  * [Source code][2] on *GitHub*
* **Detailed documentation**
  * [Detailed API documentation][3] on *GH-Pages*

Distributions can be compared to either sample or population data. Package
originally derived from Udacity exercises.

## Continuous Distributions

* Normal (Gaussian): bm.probability-distributions.continuous.gaussian

## Discrete Distributions

* Binomial: bm.probability-distributions.discrete.binomial
