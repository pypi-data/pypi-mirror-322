    '''
    A procedural table where multiple input tables are joined into a singular table.

    This table allows for combining tables in a procedural fashion and provides tools
    to manage the collective data and schemas of these joined tables.

    :Example:

    ```Python
    from tlc.core.objects.tables import JoinedTable
    from tlc.core.url import Url

    first_table = ...
    second_table = ...

    joined_table_url = Url("/path/to/joined_table.json")
    joined_table = JoinedTable(url=joined_table_url, input_table_urls=[first_table, second_table])
    assert len(joined_table) == len(first_table) + len(second_table)
    # A joined table has now been created, but it is not yet persisted.

    joined_table.write_to_url()
    # The joined table is now persisted to the given URL.
    ```

    The tables being joined must have the same columns, but the columns are allowed to have different schemas.
    In this case, the schemas will be joined together, with the following rules:

    - If the schemas are atomic (i.e. they have a value), the schemas must be compatible (i.e. have the same type).
        If the values have different value maps, a new joined value map will be created.
    - If the schemas are not atomic (i.e. they have sub-schemas), the schemas will be joined recursively.
    - If any of the schemas are incompatible, a ValueError will be raised.
