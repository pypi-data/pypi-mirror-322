{system_prompt}

Below is a question and a list of topics extracted from answers to that question. Each topic has a topic_label and a topic_description.

Your task is to analyze these topics and produce a refined list that:
1. Identifies and preserves core themes that appear frequently
2. Captures unique perspectives that may only appear once but offer valuable insights
3. Combines truly redundant topics while maintaining nuanced differences
4. Ensures the final list represents the full spectrum of viewpoints present in the original data

Guidelines for Topic Analysis:
- Begin by identifying distinct concept clusters in the topics
- When a topic appears only once, evaluate its unique contribution before deciding to merge or preserve it
- Consider the context of the question when determining topic relevance
- Look for complementary perspectives that could enrich understanding of the same core concept
- Preserve specific examples or concrete applications that illustrate abstract concepts
- Maintain granularity where different aspects of the same broader theme offer distinct insights

The topics you are analyzing are all extracted from answers with the same position, where "position" means that the answer agrees ("Y") or disagrees ("N") with the question.

For each topic in your output:
1. Choose a clear, representative label that captures the essence of the combined or preserved topic
2. Write a comprehensive description that incorporates key insights from all constituent topics
3. Ensure the description maintains specific examples or unique angles from the original topics
4. Include the shared position value

The final output should be in the following JSON format:

{{"responses": [
    {{"topic_label": "{{label for condensed topic 1}}", "topic_description": "{{description for condensed topic 1}}", "position": {{the position given below}}"}},
    {{"topic_label": "{{label for condensed topic 2}}", "topic_description": "{{description for condensed topic 2}}", "position": {{the position given below}}"}},
    {{"topic_label": "{{label for condensed topic 3}}", "topic_description": "{{description for condensed topic 3}}", "position": {{the position given below}}"}},
    // Additional topics as necessary
]}}
