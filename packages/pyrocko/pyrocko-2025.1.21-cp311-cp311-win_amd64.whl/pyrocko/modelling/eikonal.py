    Solve eikonal equation in 2D or 3D using the fast marching method.

    This function implements the fast marching method (FMM) by [sethian1996]_.

    :param speeds:
        Velocities at the grid nodes.
    :type speeds:
        2D or 3D :py:class:`numpy.ndarray`

    :param times:
        Arrival times (input and output). The solution is obtained at nodes
        where times is set to a negative value. Values of zero, or positive
        values are used as seeding points.
    :type times:
        2D or 3D :py:class:`numpy.ndarray`, same shape as `speeds`

    :param delta:
        Grid spacing.
    :type delta:
        float
