Squirrel based applications can either use the user’s global Squirrel
environment or a project specific local environment. Running this command in a
project's top level directory creates a local environment. Any Squirrel
application started thereafter in this directory or any of its subdirectories,
will use the local enviroment instead of the global one.

The local enviroment consists of a directory ```.squirrel``` which contains
the Squirrel's database and a cache directory.

A local environment can be removed by removing its ```.squirrel``` directory.

The user's global enviroment database resides in Pyrocko’s global cache
directory, by default in ```$HOME/.pyrocko/cache/squirrel```.
