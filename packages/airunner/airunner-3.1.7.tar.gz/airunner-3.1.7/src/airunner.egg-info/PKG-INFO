# AI Runner 


AI Runner is an interface which allows you to run open-source large language models (LLM) and AI image generators (Stable Diffusion) on your own hardware.

It is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to run AI models without the need for a web server or cloud service.

It has been optimized for speed and efficiency, allowing you to generate images and have conversations with chatbots in real-time.

## 🚀 Installation

There are several ways to get started with AI Runner such as packaged, from source and as a library.

[Detailed packaging and installation instructions can be found in the wiki](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner/wiki/Installation-instructions).

### Install as a library

Installation

```bash
pip install airunner
```

Running

```bash
airunner
```



---

## Models

AI Runner installs all of the models required to run a chatbot with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities,
as well as the core models required for Stable Diffusion. However, you must supply your own art generator models.

You can download models from Huggingface.co or civitai.com.

The supported Stable Diffusion models are:

- SD 1.5
- SDXL 1.0
- SDXL Turbo

Models must be placed in their respective directories in the `airunner` directory.
    
```plaintext
~/.local/share/airunner
├── art
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── SD 1.5
│   │   │   ├── lora
│   │   │   └── embeddings
│   │   ├── SDXL 1.0
│   │   │   ├── lora
│   │   │   └── embeddings
│   │   └── SDXL Turbo
│   │       ├── lora
│   │       └── embeddings
```

---

## Unit tests

Run all unit tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s src/airunner/tests
```

Run a single unit tests `python -m unittest src/airunner/tests/<file_name>`

Example
```bash
python -m unittest src/airunner/tests/test_prompt_weight_convert.py
```
