- Sen2vec module provides convenient solution to transform sentences to vectors.
- The vectors transformed contain high level of information of the original sentences, 
- and this method has a wide range of applications in downstream tasks.
- The method could be directly applied to NLP tasks, 
- as well as other machine learning assignments, integrated with any structured data.
- According to application scenarios, such as the sample size of downstream tasks,
- the dimension of vector extracted by sen2vec varies.
- The vectors transformed are able to carry out the four fundamental operations of arithmetic,
- and could calculate the average, the intersection angle and the distance,
- based on different code instructions of the original information.
- The method sen2vec_fi is currently used to analyze financial texts,
- and will be developed into different versions to meet demands in diverse areas. 
- There are two ways to employ sen2vec:
- Use the default models we provide by function sen2vec_download() and sen2vec_fi
- Use the self-defined models: from sen2vec import sen2vec
