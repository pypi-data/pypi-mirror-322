        2. License Grants and Conditions
        --------------------------------
        
        2.1. Grants
        
        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
        non-exclusive license:
        
        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
            Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
            as part of a Larger Work; and
        
        (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
            for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.
        
        2.2. Effective Date
        
        The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
        become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
        distributes such Contribution.
        
        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
        
        The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
        Contributor:
        
        (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
            or
        
        (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or
        
        (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.
        
        This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
        or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
        the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
        
        2.4. Subsequent Licenses
        
        No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
        distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
        permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
        
        2.5. Representation
        
        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
        to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
        
        2.6. Fair Use
        
        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
        applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
        equivalents.
        
        2.7. Conditions
        
        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
        in Section 2.1.
        
        3. Responsibilities
        -------------------
        
        3.1. Distribution of Source Form
        
        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
        Form.
        
        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
        
        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
        
        (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
        
        (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
        
        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
        
        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
        License(s).
        
        3.4. Notices
        
        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
        or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
        the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
        the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
        
        3.5. Application of Additional Terms
        
        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
        jurisdiction.
        
        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
        the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
        describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
        be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
        Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
        or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
        
        5. Termination
        --------------
        
        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
        if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
        compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
        Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
        ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
        non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
        come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
        notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
        first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
        from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
        Your receipt of the notice.
        
        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
        counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
        2.1 of this License shall terminate.
        
        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
        have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
        prior to termination shall survive termination.

        *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
        *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
        *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
        *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
        *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
        *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
        *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
        *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *

        *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
        *                                                                      *

        *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
        *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
        *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
        *  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
        *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
        *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

        *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
        *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

        8. Litigation
        -------------
        
        Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
        courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
        place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
        Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
        cross-claims or counter-claims.
        
        9. Miscellaneous
        ----------------
        
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
        that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
        shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
        
        10. Versions of the License
        ---------------------------
        
        10.1. New Versions
        
        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
        10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
        publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.
        
        10.2. Effect of New Versions
        
        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
        of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
        or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
        steward.
        
        10.3. Modified Versions
        
        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
        such modified license differs from this License).
        
        10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
        Licenses
        
        If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
        Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
        notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

        If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
        file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
        file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
        for such a notice.
        
        You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Dockershrink can automatically apply techniques like Multi-Stage builds, switching to Lighter base images like alpine and running dependency checks. PLUS a lot more is on the roadmap :rocket:

Currently, the tool only supports [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) applications.

## Why does dockershrink exist?
Every org using containers in development or production environments understands the pain of managing hundreds or even thousands of bloated Docker images in their infrastructure.

High data storage and transfer costs, long build times, underprodctive developers - we've seen it all.

The issue becomes even more painful and costly with interpreted languages such as Nodejs & Python.
Apps written in these languages need to pack the interpreters and all their dependencies inside their container images, significantly increasing their size.

But not everyone realizes that by just implementing some basic techniques, they can reduce the size of a 1GB Docker image down to **as little as 100 MB**!

([I also made a video on how to do this.](https://youtu.be/vHBHxQfK6cM))

Imagine the costs saved in storage & data transfer, decrease in build times AND the productivity gains for developers :exploding_head:

Dockershrink aims to automatically apply advanced optimization techniques so engineers don't have to waste time on it and the organization still saves :moneybag:!

You're welcome :wink:



## How it works
When you invoke the dockershrink CLI on your project, it analyzes code files.

Dockershrink looks for the following files:

:point_right: `Dockerfile` (Required)

:point_right: `package.json` (Optional)

:point_right: `.dockerignore` (Optional, created if it doesn't already exist)

It then creates a new directory (default: `dockershrink.optimized`) inside the project, which contains modified versions of your configuration files that will result in a smaller Docker Image.

The CLI outputs a list of actions it took over your files.

It may also include suggestions on further improvements you could make.


## Installation
You can install dockershrink using PIP or PIPX
```bash
$ pip install dockershrink
```
```bash
$ pipx install dockershrink
```

Alternatively, you can also install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install duaraghav8/tap/dockershrink
```

But you should prefer to use `pip` instead because installation via brew takes a lot longer and occupies significanlty more space on your system (see [this issue](https://github.com/duaraghav8/homebrew-dockershrink/issues/3))

## Usage

Navigate into the root directory of one of your Node.js projects and invoke dockershrink with the `optimize` command:

```bash
$ dockershrink optimize
```

Dockershrink will create a new directory with the optimized files and output the actions taken and (maybe) some more suggestions.

For detailed information about the `optimize` command, run

```bash
dockershrink optimize --help
```

You can also use the `--verbose` option to get stack traces in case of failures:

```bash
$ dockershrink optimize --verbose
```

To enable `DEBUG` logs, you can set the environment variable

```bash
export DOCKERSHRINK_CLI_LOGLEVEL=DEBUG
dockershrink optimize
```

### Using AI Features

> [!NOTE]
> Using AI features is optional, but **highly recommended** for more customized and powerful optimizations.
>
> To use AI, you need to supply your own OpenAI API key, so even though Dockershrink itself is free, openai usage might incur some cost for you.

By default, dockershrink only runs rule-based analysis to optimize your image definition.

If you want to enable AI, you must supply your [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/).

```bash
dockershrink optimize --openai-api-key <your openai api key>

# Alternatively, you can supply the key as an environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openai api key>
dockershrink optimize
```

> [!NOTE]
> Dockershrink does not store your OpenAI API Key.
>
> So you must provide your key every time you want "optimize" to use AI features.
> This is to avoid any unexpected costs.


### Default file paths
By default, the CLI looks for the files to optimize in the current directory.

You can also specify the paths to all files using options (see `dockershrink optimize --help` for the available options).

## Development :computer:

> [!NOTE]
> This section is for authors and contributors.
> If you're simply interested in using Dockershrink, you can skip this section.

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate inside the root directory of the project and create a new virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install all dependencies
```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```
4. Install the editable CLI tool
```bash
# -e ensures that the tool is editable, ie, code changes reflect in the tool immediately, without having to re-install it
pip install -e .

# Try running the cli
dockershrink --help
```
5. Make your code changes
6. Run black
```bash
black .
```
7. In case of any changes in dependencies, update requirements.txt
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Release :rocket:
Once all code changes have been made for the next release:
- Upgrade the version in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) and [cli.py](./dockershrink/cli.py)
- Make sure that dependencies and their versions are updated in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) and pyproject.toml

Then proceed to follow these steps to release new dockershrink version on PyPI:

1. Build dockershrink from source
```bash
python -m build
