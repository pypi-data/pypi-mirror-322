# luvex
Developing ML Models from scratch : Regression - Linear (Least Squares Method), Multiple Linear. Classification - KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

# Luvex

Luvex is a Python package for implementing machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and more.

## Installation

You can install `luvex` from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install luvex


## Testing Linear Regression
import numpy as np
from luvex import Linearregression  # Replace with the actual import path of your model

def test_linear_regression():
    # Training data: 5 samples with single feature
    X_train = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Single feature (1D array)
    y_train = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])  # Target values
    X_test = np.array([6])  # Test data

    # Initialize and train the model
    model = Linearregression(learning_rate=0.001, epochs=1000)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Assert predictions are of correct shape
    assert predictions.shape == X_test.shape, f"Expected shape {X_test.shape}, got {predictions.shape}"

    # Assert predictions are close to expected values
    # Adjust the expected values based on the specifics of the model
    expected_predictions = np.array([12.0])  # Expected output for X_test
    #assert np.allclose(predictions, expected_predictions, atol=0.1), \
        #f"Expected {expected_predictions}, but got {predictions}"

    print("All tests passed for LinearRegression")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_linear_regression()



## Testing Logistic Regression

import numpy as np
from luvex import Logisticregression  # Replace with your actual import path

def test_logistic_regression():
    # Training data: 3 samples with 2 features each
    X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])
    y_train = np.array([0, 1, 0])
    X_test = np.array([[2, 3]])
    y_test = np.array([1])

    # Initialize and train the model
    model = Logisticregression(learn_rate=0.01, n_iter=1000, verbose=True)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    print(f"Predictions: {predictions}")

    # Assert predictions are binary (0 or 1)
    assert np.all(np.isin(predictions, [0, 1])), "Predictions should be binary."

    # Evaluate accuracy
    acc = model.accu_score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {acc:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_logistic_regression()
    print("All tests passed for Logisticregression")


## Test KNN

import numpy as np
from luvex import KNN  # Import your model

def test_knn():
    X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])
    y_train = np.array([0, 1, 0])
    X_test = np.array([[2, 2]])
    
    model = KNN(k=2)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    
    assert predictions >= [0]  # Test if the prediction is correct

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_knn()
    print("All tests passed for KNN")

## Test MultiLinear Regression
import numpy as np
from luvex import MultipleLinear  # Replace with your actual import

def test_multiple_linear():
    # Training data: 3 samples with 2 features each
    X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])
    y_train = np.array([1, 2, 3]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Reshape to column vector
    X_test = np.array([[2, 3], [3, 4]])  # Test data
    y_test = np.array([2, 3]).reshape(-1, 1)

    # Initialize and train the model
    model = MultipleLinear(learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Assert predictions are of correct shape
    assert predictions.shape == y_test.shape, f"Expected shape {y_test.shape}, got {predictions.shape}"

    # Evaluate the model
    mse = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Predictions: {predictions.flatten()}")
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

    # Assert that MSE is within a reasonable range
    assert mse < 0.1, f"High Mean Squared Error: {mse}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_multiple_linear()
    print("All tests passed for MultipleLinear")

    model = DecisionTree()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    assert predictions[0] >= 1  # Fix the expected prediction here based on your model



if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_decision_tree()
    print("All tests passed for DecisionTree")

## Testing Random Forests

import numpy as np

    model = RandomForest(n_trees=3, max_depth=5, min_samples_split=2, n_features=1)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    assert predictions[0] >= 0  # Modify to check the first value in the returned array
