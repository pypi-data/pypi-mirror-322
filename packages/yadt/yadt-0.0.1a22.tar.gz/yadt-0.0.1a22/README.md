# Yet Another Document Translator

## Getting Started

### Install from PyPI

We recommend using the Tool feature of [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to install yadt.

1. First, you need to refer to [uv installation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation) to install uv and set up the `PATH` environment variable as prompted.

2. Use the following command to install yadt:
```bash
uv tool install --python 3.12 yadt

yadt --help
```

3. Use the `yadt` command. For example:
```bash
yadt --bing  --files example.pdf

# multiple files
yadt --bing  --files example1.pdf --files example2.pdf
```

### Install from Source

We still recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage virtual environments.

1. First, you need to refer to [uv installation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation) to install uv and set up the `PATH` environment variable as prompted.

2. Use the following command to install yadt:
```bash
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/funstory-ai/yadt

# enter the project directory
cd yadt

# install dependencies and run yadt
uv run yadt --help
```

3. Use the `uv run yadt` command. For example:
```bash
uv run yadt --bing --files examples/pdf/il_try_1/这是一个测试文件.pdf

# multiple files
uv run yadt --bing --files examples/pdf/il_try_1/这是一个测试文件.pdf --files example2.pdf
```

## Background

There a lot projects and teams working on to make document editing and tranlslating easier like:

- [mathpix](https://mathpix.com/)
- [Doc2X](https://doc2x.noedgeai.com/)
- [minerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU)
- [PDFMathTranslate](https://github.com/Byaidu/PDFMathTranslate)

There are also some solutions to solve specific parts of the problem like:

- [layoutreader](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutreader): the read order of the text block in a pdf
- [Surya](https://github.com/surya-is/surya): the structure of the pdf

This project hope to promote a standard pipeline and interface to solve the problem.

In fact, there are two mainy stage of a PDF parser or translator:

- **Parsing**: A stage of parsing means to get the structure of the pdf such as text blocks, images, tables, etc.
- **Rendering**: A stage of rendering means to render the structure into a new pdf or other format.

For a service like mathpix, it will parse the pdf into a structure may be in a XML format, and then render them using a single column reader order as [layoutreader](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutreader) does. The bad news is that the orignal structure lost.

Some people will use Adobe PDF Parser because it will generate a Word document and it keep the original structure. But it is some while expensive.
And you know, a pdf or word document is not a good for reading in mobile devices.

We offer a intermediate representation of the results from parser and can be rendered into a new pdf or other format. The pipeline is also a plugin-based system which everybody can add their new model, ocr, renderer, etc.

## Roadmap

Our fisrt 1.0 version goal is to finish a translation from [PDF Reference, Version 1.7](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/pdfstandards/pdfreference1.7old.pdf) to the following language version:

- Simplified Chinese
- Traditional Chinese
- Japanese
- Spanish

And meet the following requirements:

- layout error less than 1%
- content loss less than 1%


## Known Issues

1. Parsing errors in the author and reference sections; they get merged into one paragraph after translation.
2. Lines are not supported.
3. Poor support for capitalizing initial letters.
4. Multi-letter corner mark
