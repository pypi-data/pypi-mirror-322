# ![Shaka Streamer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaka-project/shaka-streamer/main/docs/source/shaka-streamer-logo.png)

Shaka Streamer offers a simple config-file based approach to preparing streaming
media. It greatly simplifies the process of using FFmpeg and Shaka Packager for
both VOD and live content.

Live documentation can be found at
https://shaka-project.github.io/shaka-streamer/ and is generated from the
`docs/source/` folder, as well as the source code itself.

Sample configs can be found in the [`config_files/`] folder in the repo.

[`config_files/`]: https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-streamer/tree/main/config_files
