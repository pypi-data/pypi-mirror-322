def merge_ordered_lists(md):
    """
    A plugin to merge consecutive "top-level" ordered lists into one,
    and also attach any intervening code blocks or blank lines to the
    last list item so that the final BBCode appears as a single list
    with multiple steps.

    This relies on a few assumptions:
      1) The only tokens between two ordered lists that should be merged
         are code blocks or blank lines (not normal paragraphs).
      2) We want any code block(s) right after a list item to appear in
         that same bullet item.
