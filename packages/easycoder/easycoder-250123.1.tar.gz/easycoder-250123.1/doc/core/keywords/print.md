# print

## Syntax:
`print {value}`
## Examples:
``print `Hello, world!` ``  
`print Data cat newline`

## Description:
Print something to the terminal. The second example shows the use of string catenation, which is also covered in [values](../core.md).  
The output is prefixed by the script line number of the print command. This is very useful in large scripts when trying to figure where print output is coming from.
