# tcpp

A Python implementation of TCP ping that tests connectivity to a remote host by attempting TCP connections. It measures connection establishment times and provides detailed statistics.

## Features

- üöÄ Pure Python implementation, no external dependencies
- üì¶ Lightweight and easy to use
- üåê Supports both IPv4 and IPv6
- üîÑ Supports continuous ping mode

## Installation

You can install `tcpp` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install tcpp
```

## Usage

### Command Line

Basic usage:
```bash
tcpp bing.com
```

With custom port and count:
```bash
tcpp bing.com 443 -c 10
```

All available options:
```bash
tcpp [-h] [-c COUNT] [-t TIMEOUT] [-4] [-6] [-v] host [port]

positional arguments:
  host                  Target hostname or IP address to ping
  port                  Target port number (default: 80)

options:
  -h, --help           Show this help message and exit
  -c, --count COUNT    Number of pings to send (default: 10, 0 = infinite)
  -t, --timeout SEC    Connection timeout in seconds (default: 1.0)
  -4                   Force using IPv4
  -6                   Force using IPv6
  -v, --version        Show program version
```

### Python API

You can also use tcpp as a Python library:

```python
import tcpp

# Basic usage
stats = tcpp.ping("bing.com", port=80)

# Access statistics
print(f"Success rate: {stats.success_rate}%")
print(f"Average time: {stats.avg_time:.2f}ms")
```

## bing Output
