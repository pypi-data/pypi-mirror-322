--INSERT INTO speeches (position, phase_name_or_tag, language_code, sound_path) VALUES
--('LOC_SPEECH_WELCOME', 'phase1', 'en_US', 'welcome.ogg') -- just as an example, please refer to localizations.sqlite_compileoption_get
-- The speech files should be saved in the assets/sounds folder. Please see pygame sounds to know what extension to use.
-- Example, ('LOC_WELCOME', 'phase1', 'en_US', 'welcome.ogg') means that the sound localized at assets/sounds/welcome.ogg will be
-- played every time >>> sound = Speeches.get('LOC_WELCOME') >>> self.soundbox.play(sound) is called, having en_US as the current language.
-- Remember to add the category of 'welcome.ogg' in the assets/sounds/categories.json file, as "speech" if you want all
-- the speeches to have the same volume, or with any other category you want. Remember to adjust the data/settings.json as well.
