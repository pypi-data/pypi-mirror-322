# Sonar Tool Configuration

## Overview
The `SonarToolConfig` class is part of the CodeMie project, specifically located in the `src/codemie_tools/code/sonar/config.py` file. This class is designed to hold the configuration settings for the Sonar tool, which is commonly used for continuous code quality inspection and management.

## Class Structure
The `SonarToolConfig` class inherits from `BaseModel` provided by Pydantic, which allows for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. The class contains the following optional attributes:

- `url`: A string representing the URL of the Sonar server.
- `sonar_token`: A string token for authenticating with the Sonar server.
- `sonar_project_name`: A string that specifies the name of the project in Sonar.

## Potential Value
The configuration provided by the `SonarToolConfig` class is crucial for integrating Sonar into development workflows, enabling teams to maintain high code quality by:
- Automating code analysis to identify bugs and vulnerabilities.
- Facilitating continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.
- Enhancing collaboration among team members by standardizing project settings.

By utilizing this configuration model, developers can easily manage and extend their Sonar setup, ensuring that their codebase adheres to best practices and remains maintainable.
