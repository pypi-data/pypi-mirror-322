# Data Management Toolkit

## Overview
The `DataManagementToolkit` class extends the `BaseToolkit` class and provides an integrated solution for managing data through various tools, specifically focusing on ElasticSearch and SQL databases.

## Features
- **ElasticSearch Integration**: Leverages the `SearchElasticIndex` tool to perform searches on ElasticSearch indices.
- **SQL Management**: Incorporates `SQLTool` for SQL database interactions, allowing for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

## Configuration
The toolkit requires configurations for both ElasticSearch and SQL to function properly. These configurations are encapsulated in the `ElasticConfig` and `SQLConfig` classes, respectively. 

## Key Methods
- `get_tools_ui_info`: Returns metadata about the available tools for the UI.
- `get_tools`: Initializes and returns the tools available in this toolkit based on the provided configurations.
- `get_toolkit`: A factory method for creating an instance of `DataManagementToolkit` with the given configurations.

## Potential Business Value
The `DataManagementToolkit` enables businesses to efficiently manage and query their data across different platforms. By providing a unified interface to both ElasticSearch and SQL databases, it streamlines data operations, reduces complexity, and enhances productivity. This toolkit is particularly valuable for organizations that rely on large datasets and require robust search and data management capabilities.
