# Business Description for diff_update_coder.py

## Overview
The `diff_update_coder.py` module is designed to facilitate the process of updating code content based on specified tasks. It employs a language model (LLM) to interpret and apply changes to the code while ensuring that the modified code adheres to defined coding standards.

## Key Functions
1. **update_content_by_task(old_content, task_details, llm)**: This function updates the existing content by interacting with the LLM using the provided task details. It manages LLM parameters and handles retries in case of failures.

2. **solve_task_with_retry(old_content, task_details, llm)**: Attempts to solve the task by calling the LLM and processing its responses, with mechanisms to retry on failure.

3. **call_and_process_llm(llm, messages, old_content)**: Invokes the LLM with a set of messages and processes its response, applying necessary edits to the original content.

4. **extract_and_apply_edits(llm_response, old_content)**: Extracts edits from the LLM's response and applies them to the old content, validating the new content against linting standards.

5. **pretty_format_edits(edits)**: Formats the edits for display, providing a clear overview of changes made.

## Error Handling
The module contains robust error handling mechanisms to manage various failure scenarios, such as unmatched search/replace blocks, linting errors, and more. It provides meaningful error messages to aid in debugging.

## Linting Integration
The `LinterFacade` is utilized to ensure that the resulting code after updates meets coding standards, helping to maintain code quality within the project.

## Conclusion
Overall, the `diff_update_coder.py` module serves as a crucial component in the automation of code updates, leveraging AI capabilities to enhance productivity and maintain high coding standards.
