# Business Description for utils.py

The `utils.py` module provides utility functions for file management and path validation within a specified root directory. It includes the following key functions:

## Functions:

### `get_relative_path(root_dir: str, file_path: str) -> Path`
- **Description:** Returns the relative path of a given file path with respect to the specified root directory. If the root directory is not provided, it returns the full path of the file.

### `get_validated_relative_path(root: Path, user_path: str) -> Path`
- **Description:** Resolves a user-provided path to ensure it is within the allowed root directory. Raises a `FileValidationError` if the path is outside the permitted directory.

### `is_relative_to(path: Path, root: Path) -> bool`
- **Description:** Checks if a given path is relative to the specified root directory. This function utilizes Python 3.9+ features for improved reliability.

### `create_folders(file_path)`
- **Description:** Creates the necessary directories for a specified file path if they do not already exist, ensuring that the file can be saved without errors.

## Logging:
- The module uses the `logging` library to provide debug information about the creation of directories and path validation errors.
