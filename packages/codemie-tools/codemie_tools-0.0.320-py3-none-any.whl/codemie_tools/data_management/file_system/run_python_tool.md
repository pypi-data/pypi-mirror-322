# Business Description for run_python_tool.py

## Overview
The `run_python_tool.py` script is a component of the CodeMie toolset designed to execute Python scripts in a safe and controlled environment. This tool is particularly useful for running arbitrary Python code, allowing users to leverage the full functionality of Python libraries available in the environment.

## Key Features
- **Script Execution**: The tool allows users to run complete Python scripts, provided they follow specific formatting guidelines. It accepts scripts that are pure Python code, ensuring compatibility with various Python packages such as `requests`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `numpy`, and `pandas`.
- **Safety Warning**: A warning is logged whenever the Python REPL is used, reminding users of the risks associated with executing arbitrary code.
- **Output Handling**: Users are instructed to print outputs directly and to write any generated files to the current directory.
- **Plot Generation**: The tool includes guidelines for generating plots using `matplotlib`, ensuring that visual outputs are created correctly without using `plt.savefig()`.

## Classes and Functions
- **PythonRunCodeInput**: A Pydantic model that defines the input schema for the Python script to be executed. It includes a detailed description of how to format the input script.
- **PythonRunCodeTool**: This class extends the `CodeMieTool` and implements the logic for executing the provided Python scripts. It also handles logging and result reporting.

## Usage
To use this tool, users must provide a complete Python script as a string. The script should not be wrapped in backticks and should be properly formatted to ensure successful execution.
