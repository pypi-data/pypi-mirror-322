# GitLab Toolkit

## Overview
The GitLab Toolkit is a collection of tools designed to facilitate interactions with GitLab repositories. It is built on top of the `BaseToolkit` class and integrates various utilities for managing files, branches, and pull requests within GitLab.

## Components
- **Logging**: The toolkit uses Python's built-in logging library to provide debug information.
- **Git Credentials**: It encapsulates GitLab API credentials using the `GitCredentials` class.
- **API Wrapper**: The toolkit initializes a GitLab API wrapper to perform operations.
- **Language Model**: It includes optional integration with language models for advanced functionalities.

## Core Functionalities
1. **File Management**:  
   - Create and delete files in the GitLab repository.
   - Update files using OpenAI tools.

2. **Branch Management**:  
   - List branches and set the active branch.
   - Create new branches in the GitLab repository.

3. **Pull Requests**:  
   - Create pull requests and comments on pull request changes.
   - Retrieve changes from pull requests.

## Usage
To use the GitLab Toolkit, initialize it with GitLab API credentials and retrieve the available tools:
```python
# Example usage
configs = {'gitlab_token': 'your_token', 'gitlab_url': 'https://gitlab.com'}
toolkit = CustomGitLabToolkit.get_toolkit(configs)
tools = toolkit.get_tools()
```

## Conclusion
The GitLab Toolkit streamlines the process of managing GitLab repositories and enhances productivity through automation and integration with AI-driven tools.
