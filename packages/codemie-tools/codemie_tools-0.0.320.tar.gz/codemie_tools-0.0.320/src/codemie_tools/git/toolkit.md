# Git Toolkit Class Description

The `GitToolkit` class is part of the Codemie Tools project and serves as a framework for interacting with various Git repository platforms, including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. It facilitates the management of tools related to Git operations and provides a user interface for these tools.

## Key Components:

1. **Imports**: The class imports necessary modules and classes from `langchain_core` and various toolkit modules for different Git platforms.

2. **Constants**: It defines constants for different repository types: `TYPE_GITHUB`, `TYPE_GITLAB`, `TYPE_BITBUCKET`, and `TYPE_UNKNOWN`.

3. **GitToolkitUI Class**: This inner class represents the user interface for the Git toolkit and defines a set of tools that can be used for Git operations such as creating branches, updating files, and managing pull requests.

4. **GitToolkit Class**: The main class that encapsulates the logic for interacting with the selected Git toolkit. It includes methods for:
   - Retrieving tool information (`get_tools_ui_info`).
   - Retrieving a list of available tools (`get_tools`).
   - Initializing the appropriate toolkit based on the repository type (`get_toolkit`).

## Tool List:
The tools available in the toolkit include:
- Create Git Branch
- Set Active Branch
- List Branches
- Create File
- Update File
- Update File Diff
- Delete File
- Create Pull Request
- Get PR Changes
- Create PR Change Comment

## Usage:
To use the `GitToolkit`, one would typically instantiate it with necessary configurations and call its methods to perform Git operations as needed.
