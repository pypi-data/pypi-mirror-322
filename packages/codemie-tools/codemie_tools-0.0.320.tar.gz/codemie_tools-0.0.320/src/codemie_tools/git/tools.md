# Business Description for `src/codemie_tools/git/tools.py`

The `tools.py` file in the `codemie_tools.git` module defines an abstract class `UpdateFileGitTool` that extends the `CodeMieTool` base class. This class is designed to facilitate updates to files in a Git repository by providing methods that allow for reading existing file content, updating that content based on specific task details, and committing the changes back to the repository.

## Key Components:

- **Logging**: The module uses Python's `logging` library to log errors and important information, which helps in debugging and tracking the flow of execution.

- **Git Credentials**: It utilizes the `GitCredentials` class to manage authentication details required for Git operations.

- **Abstract Methods**: The class defines several abstract methods (`read_file`, `update_content`, and `update_file`) that must be implemented by any subclasses. This ensures that the specific behavior for reading files, updating content, and committing changes can be tailored to different use cases or environments.

### Method Descriptions:

- **execute**: This method is responsible for orchestrating the file update process. It reads the current file content, applies updates based on the provided task details, and writes the changes back to the file while logging any errors encountered during the process.

- **read_file**: An abstract method that, when implemented, should define how to read the content of a specified file.

- **update_content**: Another abstract method that must be implemented to provide the logic for updating the file content based on the legacy content and task specifics.

- **update_file**: This abstract method should contain the logic for committing the new content back to the specified file with an appropriate commit message.

This architecture allows for extensibility and reusability within the `CodeMieTool` framework, enabling developers to implement various Git file update strategies while maintaining a consistent interface.
