# Business Description of BaseToolkit

The `BaseToolkit` class serves as an abstract base class for toolkits in the CodeMie platform. It is implemented using the Pydantic library for data validation and settings management.

## Key Features:
- **Abstract Methods:**
  - `get_tools(*args, **kwargs)`: This method must be implemented by subclasses to return a list of tools associated with the toolkit.
  - `get_tools_ui_info(*args, **kwargs)`: This method must be implemented to provide user interface details for the tools in the toolkit.
  - `get_toolkit(*args, **kwargs)`: This method must be implemented to return the toolkit itself.

## Inheritance:
The `BaseToolkit` class inherits from both `BaseModel` and `ABC`, indicating that it is designed to be subclassed and cannot be instantiated directly.

## Usage:
Subclasses of `BaseToolkit` should implement the abstract methods to define specific functionalities and tools relevant to their context, ensuring a consistent interface for all toolkits.
