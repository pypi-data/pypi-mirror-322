# Business Description for SonarToolkit

## Overview
The `SonarToolkit` class is part of the Codemie tools library, specifically designed to interface with SonarQube for code quality analysis. This toolkit enables users to manage and utilize various tools available within the Sonar ecosystem.

## Components
- **SonarToolkitUI**: A user interface representation of the toolkit that provides metadata and configuration settings for the Sonar tools available.
- **SonarToolkit**: The main class that handles the configuration and instantiation of the Sonar tools. It includes methods to retrieve UI information and tools based on the provided configurations.

## Key Features
1. **Configuration Management**: The toolkit allows for the management of SonarQube credentials through the `SonarToolConfig` class, ensuring secure access to the Sonar services.
2. **Dynamic Tool Retrieval**: The `get_tools()` method allows for dynamic retrieval of tools based on the current configuration, providing flexibility and ease of use for developers.
3. **Integration with BaseToolkit**: By inheriting from `BaseToolkit`, `SonarToolkit` ensures consistent integration and functionality across various toolkits within the Codemie framework.

## Usage
To utilize the `SonarToolkit`, configurations must be provided that include Sonar credentials. Users can then create an instance of `SonarToolkit` and access the available tools for code quality analysis.
