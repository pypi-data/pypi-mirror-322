## What is Taior?

**Taior** is an advanced, cutting-edge decentralized network that redefines the way we think about **secure** and **anonymous** communication. Built for those who demand privacy, it enables peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfers and data exchanges free from surveillance, censorship, or centralized control.

With **Taior**, your communications are encrypted with military-grade cryptography, routed through a dynamic mesh network, and kept completely **anonymous**. Whether you're sharing sensitive files, communicating with peers, or simply want to disappear into the digital noise â€” Taior makes it possible.

## Why Choose Taior?

Taior isn't just another privacy tool. Itâ€™s a **system built by privacy advocates, for privacy advocates**, designed to be as secure, scalable, and efficient as the real-world demands of todayâ€™s digital society. Below are the core features that make **Taior** the **ultimate choice for those who prioritize security**:

## Key Features

- **Complete Anonymity**  
  Communication between nodes is shielded from eavesdropping, maintaining **absolute privacy**. Only you and your intended recipient have the decryption keys, ensuring full anonymity even against sophisticated adversaries.
  
- **End-to-End Encryption**  
  With **AES-256** encryption, your data is locked down with military-grade security from the moment it leaves your machine, ensuring that nobody â€” not even us â€” can access it.

- **Distributed, Decentralized**  
  Forget central servers â€” Taiorâ€™s fully decentralized architecture ensures there are no weak points, no single points of failure, and no way for your data to be intercepted or tampered with.

- **Cryptographically Secure Routing**  
  Using the **X25519** algorithm for key exchange and the **SHA-256** hash function for integrity verification, Taior ensures that your communication is not only private, but also protected against attacks.

- **Peer-to-Peer Mesh Network**  
  Build a resilient network without reliance on centralized infrastructure. Nodes in Taior form a self-healing mesh, automatically optimizing routing paths for **maximum efficiency** and **security**.

- **CLI for Advanced Control**  
  Taior's Command Line Interface (CLI) allows full control of your node and network configurations. Whether you're an admin, a power user, or a privacy-conscious individual, Taior gives you the tools to **customize** and **optimize** your experience.

## Installation

Ready to take control of your digital privacy? Install Taior easily with pip:

```sh
pip install taior
```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```sh
pip install --upgrade taior
```

To uninstall Taior:

```sh
pip uninstall taior
```

To ensure you completely remove the package, use:

```sh
pip uninstall -y taior
```

## How Taior Works

Taior operates on a powerful, flexible framework designed to maximize privacy and minimize exposure:

- **Server & Client Modes**  
  Start as a server to receive incoming connections or act as a client to send files securely to other peers. Itâ€™s entirely up to you â€” you decide your role on the network.

- **Key Generation & Authentication**  
  Each node generates unique cryptographic keys (private and public), enabling secure authentication and the establishment of encrypted communication channels.

- **File Encryption & Decryption**  
  Files are encrypted using a shared secret key generated from the public keys of communicating nodes. Only the intended recipient can decrypt the files with their private key.

- **Peer Discovery & Persistence**  
  Nodes keep track of known peers via a JSON-based registry, facilitating seamless connection to other peers, and ensuring easy expansion of your trusted network.

## Security Features

Security is woven into the very fabric of Taior. Hereâ€™s how we make sure your data stays safe:

- **AES-256 Encryption**  
  File contents are encrypted using AES-256 to prevent unauthorized access â€” no backdoors, no exceptions.

- **X25519 for Key Exchange**  
  Securely exchange keys between peers with the elliptic curve **X25519** â€” a trusted algorithm for protecting communication against future quantum threats.

- **SHA-256 Integrity Check**  
  Every file sent through Taior is verified using **SHA-256**, ensuring that no tampering occurs during transmission.

- **Decentralized Network Design**  
  Taior operates without central control, ensuring that your communication is never at risk from a single compromised point.

## Project Vision

- **Mission**  
  Taior was created with a single mission: to give users control over their privacy in a world where surveillance is omnipresent. We believe that freedom of communication is a fundamental right, and Taior was built to ensure that right remains unbroken, even in the face of increasing global censorship and control.

- **Future Commitment**  
  As digital threats evolve, Taior evolves. With advanced cryptography, a robust P2P architecture, and constant innovation, weâ€™re committed to providing a solution that scales with the needs of users who care deeply about their privacy.
