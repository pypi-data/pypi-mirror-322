# Taior

## What is Taior?

Taior is a P2P (peer-to-peer) network designed for the secure exchange of files between nodes. It uses advanced cryptography to ensure the privacy and integrity of data during transmission. Taior allows users to share files efficiently and securely, without relying on centralized servers.

## History

Taior was created in response to the growing need for file-sharing solutions that prioritize privacy and security. In a world where personal data is increasingly vulnerable, Taior seeks to offer an alternative that allows users to share information without compromising their security. Since its inception, Taior has evolved to incorporate cutting-edge encryption technologies and a robust network design.

## How It Works

Taior operates on a P2P network model, where each node acts as both a client and a server. This means that users can send and receive files directly to and from each other, without the need for an intermediary. The basic operational steps are as follows:

1. **Connecting to the Network**: Users connect to the Taior network using a unique identifier (Taior URI) that allows them to be recognized by other nodes.

2. **Key Exchange**: Before sending a file, nodes exchange public keys to establish a secure connection. This allows for the derivation of a shared key that will be used to encrypt the data.

3. **File Encryption**: Files are encrypted using robust encryption algorithms before being sent. This ensures that only the recipient, who possesses the appropriate key, can decrypt and access the content.

4. **File Transmission**: Encrypted files are sent directly between nodes over the network, ensuring that the data is not accessible to third parties.

5. **Decryption and Storage**: Once the file reaches the recipient, it is decrypted using the shared key and stored on their device.

## Security

Security is one of Taior's main priorities. Below are some of the security features implemented:

- **Data Encryption**: Taior uses state-of-the-art encryption algorithms (such as AES) to protect files during transmission. This ensures that the data is unreadable to anyone attempting to intercept it.

- **Secure Key Exchange**: The key exchange is performed using asymmetric cryptography, ensuring that only authorized nodes can access the shared key.

- **Data Integrity**: Taior implements mechanisms to verify the integrity of the data, ensuring that files are not altered during transmission.

- **Decentralization**: By operating on a P2P model, Taior eliminates the reliance on centralized servers, reducing the risk of attacks and data breaches.
