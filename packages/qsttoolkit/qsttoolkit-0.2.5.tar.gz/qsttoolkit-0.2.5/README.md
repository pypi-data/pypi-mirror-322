# QSTToolkit

QSTToolkit is an open-source package for performing optical quantum state tomography (QST) research using both traditional (statistical) and novel deep learning-powered methods in Python. Key functionality includes:
- Fast, compute-efficient and customisable generation of realistic synthetic data for a variety of optical quantum states using the [QuTiP](https://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/index.html) package.
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation quantum state tomography.
- A variety of deep learning powered methods for quantum state discrimination and tomography.

This work is the culmination of a physics masters project by George FitzGerald (gwfitzg@hotmail.com) at [Durham University's Department of Physics](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/physics/).

## Setup

QSTToolkit is currently available on [TestPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/) whilst testing continues.

### Local Installation

 **To install QSTToolkit and run the example notebooks** in a local virtual environment (not recommended for heavy deep learning tasks):

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/georgefitzgerald02/qst-toolkit.git
    cd qst-toolkit
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies - some required package versions are not available on TestPyPi:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install QSTToolkit from TestPyPi:
    ```bash
    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qsttoolkit
    ```

5. Create an iPython kernel in your virtual environment which allows the installed packages to be accessed by the notebooks:
    ```bash
    pip install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=qsttoolkit_kernel
    ```
    `qsttoolkit_kernel` should now be available to select from the list of available kernels in the Jupyter notebook interface.

**To install QSTToolkit to your global environment** or a custom virtual environment for your own use, activate the environment in question and then:

1. Install dependencies - some required package versions are not available on TestPyPi:
    ```bash
    !pip install numpy==1.26.4 pandas==2.2.2 scipy==1.13.1 matplotlib==3.9.2 seaborn==0.13.2 qutip==5.0.4 scikit-learn==1.5.1 tensorflow==2.10.0
    ```

2. Install QSTToolkit from TestPyPi:
    ```bash
    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qsttoolkit
    ```
    
3. If you are planning to run Jupyter notebooks, create an iPython kernel in your virtual environment which allows the installed packages to be accessed by the notebooks:
    ```bash
    pip install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=qsttoolkit_kernel
    ```
    `qsttoolkit_kernel` should now be available to select from the list of available kernels in the Jupyter notebook interface.

### Google Colab

**To use QSTToolkit in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**, run the following Google Colab-specific setup cell once each time you open your project in order to install non-default package dependencies to the runtime:

```python
!pip install numpy==1.26.4 pandas==2.2.2 scipy==1.13.1 matplotlib==3.9.2 seaborn==0.13.2 qutip==5.0.4 scikit-learn==1.5.1 tensorflow==2.10.0
!pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qsttoolkit
```

**To run the example notebooks in Google Colab**, click *File*, *Open notebook*, *GitHub*, and in the *Enter a GitHub URL or search by organisation or user* box, paste the URL of this repository: (https://github.com/georgefitzgerald02/qst-toolkit). Then navigate to the example notebook of your choice and open it. The above cell is included at the start of each example notebook and should be run once upon opening.

## Usage

### Importing QSTToolkit

The features of QSTToolkit are organised into two main subpackages, `qsttoolkit.data` and `qsttoolkit.tomography`, along with additional miscellaneous modules such as `qsttoolkit.plots` and `qsttoolkit.quantum`. In the example notebooks, features that belong to one of the main subpackages are called from their subpackage, to demonstrate their location in the overall package.

```python
import qsttoolkit as qst

cat_batch = qst.data.CatStates(n_states = 1000, N = dim, alpha_magnitude_range = [0, 10])

MLE_reconstructor = qst.tomography.MLEQuantumStateTomography(dim)

print(qst.fidelity(test_state.full(), MLE_reconstructor.reconstructed_dm))
```

However, **all public classes and functions in QSTToolkit can also be called directly** from `qsttoolkit`, for example:

```python
import qsttoolkit as qst

cat_batch = qst.CatStates(n_states = 1000, N = dim, alpha_magnitude_range = [0, 10])
```

### Synthetic Data Generation (`qsttoolkit.data`)

QSTToolkit provides an expansion to the existing [QuTiP](https://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/index.html) framework for producing synthetic state vectors and density matrices (generally in the form of [NumPy arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/2.1/reference/generated/numpy.array.html)) for optical quantum states, with a specific focus on producing realistic data suitable for training deep learning quantum state discrimination and tomography models. On top of [Fock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fock_state), [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_state), thermal and random states which can be produced directly using [QuTiP functions](https://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/apidoc/functions.html), QSTToolkit provides functions for synthesizing specific useful superpositions of Fock and coherent states. The custom states currently provided are:
- Num states: `data.states.num_state()`
- Binomial states: `data.states.binomial_state()`
- [Cat states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_state): `data.states.cat_state()`
- Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states: `data.states.gkp_state()`

These states can be produced as pure states, or with specific sources of noise applied at customiseable levels to both density matrices and measurement images. States can be produced individually, in batches of specified size with randomised state parameters, or in specific preset datasets, intended to be standard datasets for modelling.

More states and noise sources are planned for development. To request any specific features that might be useful for your work, please contact George FitzGerald at (gwfitzg@hotmail.com).

### Quantum State Tomography (`qsttoolkit.tomography`)

QSTToolkit currently provides classes to compile and train/optimise four models:

- [Convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) powered quantum state discrimination: `tomography.dlqst.CNNQuantumStateDiscrimination`
- [Maximum likelihood estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation) (MLE) based quantum state tomography: `tomography.tradqst.MLEQuantumStateTomography`
- [Generative adversarial network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) (GAN) quantum state tomography: `tomography.dlqst.GANQuantumStateTomography`
- [Multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-task_learning) classification/regression network quantum state characterisation: `tomography.dlqst.MultitaskQuantumStateTomography`

The usage of each class varies depending on the model's composition and functionality. The `/example_notebooks` directory contains example Jupyter notebooks which run through the usage of each model, with example synthetic data preparation for the model's specific use case.
