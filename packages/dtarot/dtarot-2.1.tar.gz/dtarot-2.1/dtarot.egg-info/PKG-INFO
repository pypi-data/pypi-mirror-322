# dtarot
Discordian Tarot program

## Usage
dtarot [-m]

Prints your (or someone else's) super-helpful Discordian Tarot reading.
Adding the -m argument also provides putative meanings for the cards, for those
 unfamiliar with this deck. Of course, you're free to add whatever meaning
 you'd like; all things are true|false|meaningless anyway.
