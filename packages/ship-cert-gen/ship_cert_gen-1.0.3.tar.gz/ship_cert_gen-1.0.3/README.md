This repository is a Python port of the certificate generator in [ship-go](https://github.com/enbility/ship-go/blob/dev/cert/cert.go).
The library generates a private / public key pair along with a self-signed certificate incl. of a Subject Key Identifier (SKI) for use in [EEBUS SHIP](https://www.eebus.org/what-is-eebus/).# ship-cert-gen
