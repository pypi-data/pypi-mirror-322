class AHP(PairwiseWeightsBase):
    """
    A subclass of PairwiseWeightsBase implementing the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method [#ahp1]_.

    RI values for determination of the consistency are taken from [#ahp2]_.

    The AHP class computes weights for pairwise comparisons based on rankings or user-provided
    input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ranking : np.ndarray | list | tuple, optional
        Array representing the ranking of objects. Only one of `ranking`, `scoring`,
        `object_names`, `matrix`, or `filename` must be provided.
    scoring : np.ndarray | list | tuple, optional
        Array representing the scoring of objects.
    object_names : list of str, optional
        List of names corresponding to the objects being compared. This triggers
        manual pairwise comparison.
    matrix : np.ndarray | list | tuple, optional
        Predefined pairwise comparison matrix.
    filename : str, optional
        Path to a CSV file containing a pairwise comparison matrix.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pymcdm.weights.subjective import AHP
    >>> ahp = AHP(ranking=[1, 2, 4, 3]) # Identify weights for four criteria based on ranking
    >>> weights = ahp()
    [0.48144852 0.21998235 0.13073309 0.16783605]
    >>> ahp = AHP(object_names=['Price', 'Mileage', 'HP', 'Year']) # Identify weights based on manual comparisons
    >>> weights = ahp()
    >>> print(weights)
    [0.52407767 0.26268171 0.03742414 0.17581648]
    >>> print(ahp.get_cr())  # To calculate CR use get_cr() method

        Parameters

        Compares two objects based on their ranking values.

        This function takes into account differences between values in the ranking/scoring.

        In case of A (1) and B (9) the result will be 9, because B is nine times worse than A.
