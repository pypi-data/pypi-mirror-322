## Overview

BioFEFI is a no-code application for training and interpreting machine learning models. You can search hyper-parameters manually or ask BioFEFI to perform hyper-parameter search automatically. Also included is the ability to perform exploratory data analysis before you create any models. BioFEFI also produces publication-ready graphs along with model metrics and, of course, the models themselves!

## Install and run BioFEFI

You will need to install **Python 3.11** or **3.12** to use BioFEFI. Make sure you also install `pip` (The Python package installer). If you don't already have it installed, [get Python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

You may need to make sure you have OpenMP installed on your machine before you can install BioFEFI. In the terminal use the following commands for your OS:

On Mac:
```shell
brew install libomp
```

You may need to try `brew3` if `brew` does not work. Make sure you [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your Mac to use the `brew`/`brew3` command.

On Linux (Ubuntu)
```shell
sudo apt install libomp-dev
```

On Windows, this doesn't seem to be a problem. You should be able to proceed with installation.

For information on how to install and run BioFEFI, check the [instructions](https://biomaterials-for-medical-devices-ai.github.io/BioFEFI/users/installation.html).

## Usage

BioFEFI will open in your internet browser when you run it. The main screen will appear giving a brief introduction to the app. To the left of the screen you will see a list of pages with the different functionalities of the app. Explanations can be found in the [instructions](https://biomaterials-for-medical-devices-ai.github.io/BioFEFI/index.html).
