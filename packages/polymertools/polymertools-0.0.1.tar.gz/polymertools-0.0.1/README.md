# Polymertools

**Polymertools** is a Python package designed for the analysis of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) data. 
The package allows researchers to accurately process and analyze molecular raw GPC data.

### Current Features
- **GPC deconvolution (Mn fixed mode)**: Implements algorithms for deconvoluting GPC data, enabling the extraction of molecular weight distributions from raw chromatograms.

### Planned Features
- **CCD deconvolution**: Support for deconvolution chemical composition distribution (CCD).
- **SCB calculation**: Tools for calculating the Short Chain Branching (SCB) in polymers.
- **Rheological calculations**: Includes functionality for performing rheological calculations based on experimental data.

### Installation

To install **polymertools**, simply use `pip`:

```bash
pip install polymertools
```

### Contributing
Polymertools is open for contributions. If you'd like to help develop the package or suggest new features, please submit an issue or pull request.
