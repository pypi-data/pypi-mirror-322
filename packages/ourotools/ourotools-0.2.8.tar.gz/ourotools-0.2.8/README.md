## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The Ouro-Tools pipeline comprises five main modules, allowing seamless integration with existing bulk and single-cell long-read RNA-seq pipelines and tools. Every main module of Ouro-Tools utilizes efficient parallelization for compute-intensive tasks to facilitate the processing of large datasets. Additionally, each Ouro-Tools module employs filesystem-based locks for parallel processing of a large number of samples across multiple machines for scalability.



### What is long-read scRNA-seq? <a name="what-is-long-read-scRNA-seq"></a>

## *step 1)* Raw long-read pre-processing module (QC module)<a name="preprocessing"></a>

```python
# run LongFilterNSplit
ourotools.LongFilterNSplit(
    path_file_minimap_index_genome = path_file_minimap_index_genome,
    l_path_file_minimap_index_unwanted = [ path_file_minimap_unwanted ],
    l_path_file_fastq_input = list( f"{path_folder_data}{name_sample}.fastq.gz" for name_sample in l_name_sample ),
    l_path_folder_output = list( f"{path_folder_data}LongFilterNSplit_out/{name_sample}/" for name_sample in l_name_sample ),
    int_num_samples_analyzed_concurrently = n_workers,
    n_threads = n_workers * n_threads_for_each_worker,
)
```

As the first module of the Ouro-Tools pipeline, the raw long-read pre-processing module `LongFilterNSplit` has a dual function for (1) providing comprehensive quality control metrics of a long-read scRNA-seq experiment and (2) pre-processing of raw long-read sequencing data for the downstream analysis. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahs2202/ouro-tools/refs/heads/main/doc/img/QC-example.svg" width="850" height="412">
</p>


According to the classification results, cDNA molecules are organized into separate output FASTQ files. For the cDNA molecules that contains a single (external or internal) poly(A) tail, the read is re-oriented so that it has the same orientation as its original mRNA transcript, with the poly(A) tail at its 3’ end; the resulting long-reads of cDNAs can be utilized for strand-specific long-read RNA-seq analysis.



## *step 2)* Spliced alignment <a name="alignment"></a>

```python
# align using minimap2 (require that minimap2 executable can be found in PATH)
# below is a wrapper function for minimap2
ourotools.Workers(
    ourotools.ONT.Minimap2_Align, # function to deploy
    int_num_workers_for_Workers = n_workers, # create 'n_workers' number of workers
    # below are arguments for the function 'ourotools.ONT.Minimap2_Align'
    path_file_fastq = list( f"{path_folder_data}LongFilterNSplit_out/{name_sample}/aligned_to_genome__non_chimeric__poly_A__plus_strand.fastq.gz" for name_sample in l_name_sample ), 
    path_folder_minimap2_output = list( f"{path_folder_data}minimap2_bam_genome/{name_sample}/" for name_sample in l_name_sample ), 
    path_file_junc_bed = path_file_minimap_splice_junction, 
    path_file_minimap2_index = path_file_minimap_index_genome,
    n_threads = n_threads_for_each_worker,
)
```

*Minimap2* can be used for annotation-guided alignment based on the transcript annotations prepared by the researcher. Here, the reference annotation from Ensembl (*Ensembl release 102*) was utilized.



## *step 3)* Barcode extraction module <a name="barcode-extraction"></a>

```python
# run LongExtractBarcodeFromBAM
l_path_folder_barcodedbam = list( f"{path_folder_data}LongExtractBarcodeFromBAM_out/{name_sample}/" for name_sample in l_name_sample )
ourotools.LongExtractBarcodeFromBAM(
    path_file_valid_cb = path_file_valid_barcode_list,
    l_path_file_bam_input = list( f"{path_folder_data}minimap2_bam_genome/{name_sample}/aligned_to_genome__non_chimeric__poly_A__plus_strand.fastq.gz.minimap2_aligned.bam" for name_sample in l_name_sample ), 
    l_path_folder_output = l_path_folder_barcodedbam,
    int_num_samples_analyzed_concurrently = n_workers, 
    n_threads = n_workers * n_threads_for_each_worker,
)
```

The barcode extraction module `LongExtractBarcodeFromBAM` identifies cell barcode (**CB**) and unique molecular identifier (**UMI**) sequences for each read and exports the results as a **“barcoded” BAM file**, a BAM file containing corrected CB and UMI sequences for each read using [the predefined SAM tags](#SAM-tags).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahs2202/ouro-tools/refs/heads/main/doc/img/UMI-deduplication-example.svg" width="850" height="412">
</p>




## *step 4)* Biological full-length molecule identification module <a name="full-length-ID"></a>

```python
# run full-length ID module
# survey 5' sites for each sample
ourotools.LongSurvey5pSiteFromBAM(
    l_path_folder_input = l_path_folder_barcodedbam,
    int_num_samples_analyzed_concurrently = n_workers, 
    n_threads = n_workers * n_threads_for_each_worker,
)
# combine 5' site profiles across samples and classify each 5' profile
ourotools.LongClassify5pSiteProfiles( 
    l_path_folder_input = l_path_folder_barcodedbam,
    path_folder_output = f"{path_folder_data}LongClassify5pSiteProfiles_out/",
    n_threads = n_threads_for_each_worker,
)
# append 5' site classification results to each BAM file
ourotools.LongAdd5pSiteClassificationResultToBAM(
    path_folder_input_5p_sites = f'{path_folder_data}LongClassify5pSiteProfiles_out/',
    l_path_folder_input_barcodedbam = l_path_folder_barcodedbam,
    int_num_samples_analyzed_concurrently = n_workers, 
    n_threads = n_workers * n_threads_for_each_worker,
)
# filter artifact reads from each BAM file
ourotools.Workers(
    ourotools.FilterArtifactReadFromBAM, # function to deploy
    int_num_workers_for_Workers = n_workers, # create 'n_workers' number of workers
    # below are arguments for the function 'ourotools.FilterArtifactReadFromBAM'
    path_file_bam_input = list( f'{path_folder_data}LongExtractBarcodeFromBAM_out/{name_sample}/5pSiteTagAdded/barcoded.bam' for name_sample in l_name_sample ), 
    path_folder_output = list( f'{path_folder_data}LongExtractBarcodeFromBAM_out/{name_sample}/5pSiteTagAdded/FilterArtifactReadFromBAM_out/' for name_sample in l_name_sample ), 
)
```

The biological full-length identification module collects the lengths of guanosine homopolymers at the 5’ ends of cDNAs to identify genuine TSSs that produce capped mRNAs, depleting truncated cDNA molecules *in silico*. The module is implemented as a workflow consisting of `LongSurvey5pSiteFromBAM`, `LongClassify5pSiteProfiles`, `LongAdd5pSiteClassificationResultToBAM`, and `FilterArtifactReadFromBAM`.

</p>




## *step 5)* Size distribution normalization module <a name="size-normalization"></a>

```python
# run mRNA size distribution normalization module
# survey the size distribution of full-length mRNAs for each sample
l_full_length_bam = list( f'{path_folder_data}LongExtractBarcodeFromBAM_out/{name_sample}/5pSiteTagAdded/FilterArtifactReadFromBAM_out/valid_3p_valid_5p.bam' for name_sample in l_name_sample )
ourotools.Workers( 
    ourotools.LongSummarizeSizeDistributions,
    int_num_workers_for_Workers = n_workers, # create 'n_workers' number of workers
    path_file_bam_input = l_full_length_bam,
    path_folder_output =  list( f'{path_folder_data}LongExtractBarcodeFromBAM_out/{name_sample}/5pSiteTagAdded/FilterArtifactReadFromBAM_out/valid_3p_valid_5p.LongSummarizeSizeDistributions_out/' for name_sample in l_name_sample ),
)
# normalize size distributions
path_folder_size_norm = f"{path_folder_data}LongCreateReferenceSizeDistribution_out/"
ourotools.LongCreateReferenceSizeDistribution(
    l_path_file_distributions = list( f'{path_folder_data}LongExtractBarcodeFromBAM_out/{name_sample}/5pSiteTagAdded/FilterArtifactReadFromBAM_out/valid_3p_valid_5p.LongSummarizeSizeDistributions_out/dict_arr_dist.pkl' for name_sample in l_name_sample ),
    l_name_file_distributions = l_name_sample,
    path_folder_output = path_folder_size_norm,
    float_max_ratio_to_arr_dist_guassian_filter_min_sigma_for_dynamic_gaussian_filter_selection = 2,
    float_sigma_gaussian_filter_min = 8,
    int_min_total_read_count_for_a_peak = 30 ,
)
# based on the output, set the confident size range
str_confident_size_range = ourotools.get_confident_size_range( path_folder_size_norm )
```

The size distribution normalization module is implemented using the `LongSummarizeSizeDistributions` and `LongCreateReferenceSizeDistribution` workflows. First, using the `LongSummarizeSizeDistributions`workflow, a full-length, UMI-deduplicated cDNA size distribution is obtained from the `valid_3p_valid_5p` barcoded BAM file (representing ***in vivo* full-length mRNAs**) for each sample. Next, the reference mRNA size distribution is constructed for all the samples using the `LongCreateReferenceSizeDistribution` workflow.

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahs2202/ouro-tools/refs/heads/main/doc/img/size-normalization-example.svg" width="850" height="412">
</p>




## *step 6)* Single-cell count module <a name="single-cell-count-module"></a>

```python
# run the single-cell count module 
ourotools.LongExportNormalizedCountMatrix( 
    path_folder_ref = path_folder_count_module_index, 
    l_path_file_bam_input = l_full_length_bam,
    l_path_folder_output = list( f'{path_folder_data}LongExportNormalizedCountMatrix_out/{name_sample}/' for name_sample in l_name_sample ),
    l_name_distribution = l_name_sample,
    path_folder_reference_distribution = path_folder_size_norm,
    l_str_l_t_distribution_range_of_interest = [ ','.join( [ "raw", str_confident_size_range ] ) ],
    flag_enforce_transcript_start_site_matching_for_long_read_during_realignment = True, 
    flag_enforce_transcript_end_site_matching_for_long_read_during_realignment = True,  
)
```

The single-cell long-read count module `LongExportNormalizedCountMatrix` is largely composed of three parts: [constructing an index](#count-module-index) (only required once for each set of gene, transcript, repeat elements, and regulatory element annotations and the reference genome), assigning each read to various `buckets` (each `bucket` represent one of genes, transcripts, exons, splice junctions, TE, tCRE, and individual genomic tiles), and exporting a size distribution-normalized count matrix for each `bucket` (later these count matrixes are combined into a single size distribution-normalized count matrix as an output).

## An Ouro-Tools count module index<a name="count-module-index"></a>

The single-cell count module of Ouro-Tools utilizes <u>genome, transcriptome, and gene annotations</u> to assign reads to **genes, isoforms, and genomic bins (tiles across the genome)**. The index building process is automatic; <u>there is no needs to run a separate command in order to build the index</u>. Once Ouro-Tools processes these information before analyzing an input BAM file(s), the program saves an index in order to load the information much faster next time.

We recommends using <u>***Ensembl*** reference genome, transcriptome, and gene annotations of the same version</u> (release number). 



### Pre-built index <a name="pre-built-index"></a>

pre-built index can be downloaded using the following links (should be extracted to a folder using **tar -xf** command):

[*<u>Human (GRCh38, Ensembl version 105)</u>*](https://ouro-tools.s3.amazonaws.com/index/latest/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.105.v0.2.4.tar)

[*<u>Mouse (GRCm39, Ensembl version 105)</u>*](https://ouro-tools.s3.amazonaws.com/index/latest/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.105.v0.2.4.tar)

### Building index from scratch <a name="building-index"></a>

An Ouro-Tools index can be built on-the-fly from the input genome, transcriptome, and gene annotation files. For example, below are the list of files that were used for the pre-built Ouro-Tools index "<u>*[Human (GRCh38, Ensembl version 105)](https://ouro-tools.s3.amazonaws.com/index/latest/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.105.v0.2.4.tar)*</u>".



*required annotations* (*Ensemble version 105*):

* **path_file_fa_genome** : https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-105/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
  * A genome FASTA file. Either gzipped or plain FASTA file can be accepted.
* **path_file_gtf_genome** :  https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-105/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.105.gtf.gz
  * A GTF file. Either gzipped or plain GTF file can be accepted. Currently GFF3 format files are not supported.
