    Returns intersection area. area if intesection (0,grid_spacing**2)
    Case for no intersection will be handled before (fully included or fully excluded).
    Case 1: two intersection points (more than half of square are within radius) - 3 vertices are within circle 
    Case 2: two intersection points (more than half of square are within radius) - 1 vertex is within circle
    Case 3: two intersection points (less than half of square within radius) - 0 vertices within circle (same row or col)
    Case 4: two intersection points (unclear wheter more or less than half) - 2 vertices within circle (same row or col)
    Case 5: four intersection points (more than half of circle is included) - 2 vertices within circle (same row or col)
    
    TODO: if grid_spacing/2 is greater than radius there will be weird instances 

    This can also be done already as a function of the point offset
    and is also symmetrical towards the triangle
    the intersection area only needs to be computed for those cases where excluded cells are intersected
