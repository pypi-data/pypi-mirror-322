    Recursively performance checks on nested structure of grid cells. 
    Checks whether closest vertex of cell is within disk of specified radius, i.e. cell is at least partly contained in disk. 
    For all points for which this hold true, it checks whether furthest vertex is also in disk, i.e. cell is fully contained in disk.
    Result are stored in a 2D-matrix (number of points x number of cell to be checked) for whether cell in fully contained in disk [disks_by_cells_contains]. 
    If cell is NOT fully contained but partly respective values in partly overlap 2D-matrix are set to true [disks_by_cells_overlaps].
    The right column of both matrix is determined by first element fo remaining check_nrs.  

    For the subset of pts of which their disk have at least partly contained the checked cell the function will be called recursively to test the next cell in the hierarchy.

    neither will be any of the cells that are ranked strictly lower (i.e. nested below it in dictionary family_tree). 
    Each cell occurs only once in the family_tree.
