## What is this?

`conda spawn` is a replacement subcommand for the `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` workflow

Instead of writing state to your current shell session, `conda spawn -n ENV-NAME` will start a new shell with your activated environment. To deactivate, exit the process with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>, or run the command `exit`.

## Installation

This is a `conda` plugin and goes in the `base` environment:

```bash
conda install -n base conda-forge::conda-spawn
```

More information is available on our [documentation](https://conda-incubator.github.io/conda-spawn).
