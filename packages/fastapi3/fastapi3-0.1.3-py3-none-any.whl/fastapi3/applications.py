                The version string of OpenAPI.

                FastAPI will generate OpenAPI version 3.1.0, and will output that as
                the OpenAPI version. But some tools, even though they might be
                compatible with OpenAPI 3.1.0, might not recognize it as a valid.

                So you could override this value to trick those tools into using
                the generated OpenAPI. Have in mind that this is a hack. But if you
                avoid using features added in OpenAPI 3.1.0, it might work for your

                        that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                        not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                        that `password`.
                    * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                        `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                        corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                        valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                        so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                        error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                    It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
                    be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                    etc.
    
                    It will be used for:
    
                    * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                        show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                    * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                        `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                        corresponding JSON.
                    * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                        (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                        that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                        not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                        that `password`.
                    * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                        `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                        corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                        valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                        so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                        error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                    It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
                    be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                    etc.
    
                    It will be used for:
    
                    * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                        show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                    * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                        `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                        corresponding JSON.
                    * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                        (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                        that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                        not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                        that `password`.
                    * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                        `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                        corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                        valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                        so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                        error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                    It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
                    be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                    etc.
    
                    It will be used for:
    
                    * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                        show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                    * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                        `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                        corresponding JSON.
                    * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                        (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                        that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                        not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                        that `password`.
                    * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                        `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                        corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                        valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                        so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                        error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                    be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                    etc.
    
                    It will be used for:
    
                    * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                        show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                    * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                        `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                        corresponding JSON.
                    * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                        (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                        that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                        not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                        that `password`.
                    * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                        `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                        corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                        valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                        so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                        error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                    be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                    etc.
    
                    It will be used for:
    
                    * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                        show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                    * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                        `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                        corresponding JSON.
                    * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                        (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                        that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                        not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                        that `password`.
                    * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                        `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                        corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                        valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                        so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                        error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                    be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                    etc.
    
                    It will be used for:
    
                    * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                        show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                    * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                        `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                        corresponding JSON.
                    * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                        (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                        that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                        not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                        that `password`.
                    * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                        `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                        corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                        valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                        so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                        error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                    be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,

                    It will be used for:
    
                    * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                        show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                    * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                        `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                        corresponding JSON.
                    * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                        (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                        that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                        not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                        that `password`.
                    * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                        `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                        corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                        valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                        so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                        error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).
